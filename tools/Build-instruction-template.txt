Build instructions

Some FOSS licenses, in particular the GNU (Lesser) General Public Licenses,
require the distributor of binary software to also deliver ”scripts to control
compilation and installation” (GPL-2.0 sect. 3), i.e. build and installation
instructions as part of the complete corresponding source code. Such
instructions could read as follows (based on
https://github.com/armijnhemel/compliance-scripts/blob/master/doc/build-instructions-template.txt):

These are the build instructions to rebuild the FOSS components for [SOFTWARE
NAME AND VERSION].

Please note: Rebuilding the source code and reinstalling the resulting programs
onto the device are not supported by our technical support department! Warranty
claims on the modified software will expire, as long as the customer cannot
prove that the defect would also occur without the modification.

The instructions below have been tested on [DISTRIBUTION]. Other operating
systems or distributions have not been tested.

To rebuild the software, the following steps must be performed:

1. Installing a (virtual) machine with [DISTRIBUTION], with at least [SPACE] GiB
of free disk space available.

2. Installing the following packages:
* [PACKAGE 1]
* [PACKAGE 2]
* [PACKAGE N]

3. Creating a directory [SOURCE DIRECTORY]:
$ sudo mkdir -p [SOURCE DIRECTORY]

4. Optional: changing the owner and environment of the directory
$ sudo chown [USR:GROUP] [SOURCE DIRECTORY]
$ export [VARIABLE]

5. Unpacking the archive [SOURCE ARCHIVE] to this directory:
$ cd [SOURCE DIRECTORY]
$ tar xf [SOURCE ARCHIVE]

6. Starting the build process:
[BUILD INSTRUCTIONS]

7. After the build process is complete, the built binaries are located in
[BINARY DIRECTORY] and can be installed with [INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS].
