## Notes

One patch file adds curl licensed source code and removes GPL-2.0 licensed source code. Due to the mimic of patch files the GPL-2.0 boilerplate is contained in this file but for the produced executable the GPL-2.0 parts are most probably not relevant. If this is the case please remove the text of the GPL-2.0
