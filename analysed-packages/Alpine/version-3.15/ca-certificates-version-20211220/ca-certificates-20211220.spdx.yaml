    \ (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor,\
    \ Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim\
    \ copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\nPreamble\n\
    \nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share\
    \ and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee\
    \ your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is\
    \ free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free\
    \ Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit\
    \ to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the\
    \ GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs,\
    \ too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\
    \ Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom\
    \ to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\
    \ that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\
    \ the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you\
    \ can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions\
    \ that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\
    \ These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute\
    \ copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute\
    \ copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients\
    \ all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or\
    \ can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their\
    \ rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,\
    \ and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\
    \ and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours,\
    \ we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty\
    \ for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed\
    \ on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,\
    \ so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'\
    \ reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\
    \ patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\
    \ individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.\
    \ To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for\
    \ everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions\
    \ for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR\
    \ COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program\
    \ or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying\
    \ it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"\
    Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the\
    \ Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\
    \ that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim\
    \ or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,\
    \ translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each\
    \ licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution\
    \ and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.\
    \ The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\
    \ is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent\
    \ of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on\
    \ what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of\
    \ the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\
    \ conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\
    \ this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients\
    \ of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge\
    \ a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option\
    \ offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy\
    \ or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on\
    \ the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms\
    \ of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n\
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you\
    \ changed the files and the date of any change.\nb) You must cause any work that\
    \ you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from\
    \ the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all\
    \ third parties under the terms of this License.\nc) If the modified program normally\
    \ reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running\
    \ for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement\
    \ including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty\
    \ (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute\
    \ the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy\
    \ of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not\
    \ normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required\
    \ to print an announcement.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as\
    \ a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\
    \ and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves,\
    \ then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute\
    \ them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of\
    \ a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole\
    \ must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees\
    \ extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who\
    \ wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\
    \ your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise\
    \ the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based\
    \ on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on\
    \ the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume\
    \ of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\
    \ scope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work\
    \ based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms\
    \ of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n\
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,\
    \ which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\
    \ customarily used for software interchange; or,\nb) Accompany it with a written\
    \ offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge\
    \ no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\
    \ machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under\
    \ the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\
    \ interchange; or,\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the\
    \ offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\
    \ only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\
    \ object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection\
    \ b above.)\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\
    \ making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means\
    \ all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\
    \ definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\
    \ of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed\
    \ need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or\
    \ binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\
    \ operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself\
    \ accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code\
    \ is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\
    \ access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of\
    \ the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\
    \ along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute\
    \ the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\
    \ to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\
    \ copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\
    \ terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are\
    \ not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,\
    \ nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its\
    \ derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this\
    \ License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based\
    \ on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\
    \ all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work\
    \ based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\
    \ original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\
    \ terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\
    \ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\
    \ compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a\
    \ court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason\
    \ (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
    \ order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
    \ they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\
    \ so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\
    \ other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\
    \ Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\
    \ redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly\
    \ through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\
    \ be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of\
    \ this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,\
    \ the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is\
    \ intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section\
    \ to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest\
    \ validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting\
    \ the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\
    \ by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to\
    \ the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent\
    \ application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or\
    \ she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee\
    \ cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear\
    \ what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the\
    \ distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either\
    \ by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places\
    \ the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution\
    \ limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only\
    \ in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\
    \ the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software\
    \ Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License\
    \ from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present\
    \ version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach\
    \ version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a\
    \ version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\
    \ does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version\
    \ ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate\
    \ parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions\
    \ are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which\
    \ is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\
    \n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\
    \ THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE\
    \ WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\
    \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to\
    \ Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and\
    \ you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to\
    \ achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and\
    \ change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.\
    \ It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\
    \ convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"\
    copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\none line\
    \ to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.\nCopyright (C) yyyy\
    \ name of author\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n\
    modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\nas published by the\
    \ Free Software Foundation; either version 2\nof the License, or (at your option)\
    \ any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be\
    \ useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY\
    \ or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the\nGNU General Public License for\
    \ more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n\
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\nFoundation, Inc.,\
    \ 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.\nAlso add information\
    \ on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive,\
    \ make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\
    \nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\nGnomovision comes\
    \ with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details\ntype `show w'. This is free software,\
    \ and you are welcome\nto redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show\
    \ c'\nfor details.\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show\
    \ the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands\
    \ you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could\
    \ even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should\
    \ also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any,\
    \ to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here is a\
    \ sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright\n\
    interest in the program `Gnomovision'\n(which makes passes at compilers) written\n\
    by James Hacker.\n\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\nTy Coon, President of\
    \ Vice\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\
    \ into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may\
    \ consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\
    \ library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License\

    \n2.4. Subsequent Licenses\nNo Contributor makes additional grants as a result\
    \ of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version\
    \ of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License\
    \ (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n\n2.5. Representation\nEach\

    3. Responsibilities\n\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\nAll distribution of Covered\
    \ Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or\
    \ to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform\
    \ recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by\
    \ the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You\
    \ may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\
    \ Form.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\nIf You distribute Covered Software\
    \ in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available\
    \ in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients\
    \ of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\
    \ reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution\
    \ to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the\
    \ terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that\
    \ the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients'\
    \ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a\
    \ Larger Work\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your\
    \ choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License\
    \ for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software\
    \ with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software\
    \ is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally\
    \ distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s),\
    \ so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute\
    \ the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\
    \ License(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any\
    \ license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of\
    \ warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form\
    \ of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the\
    \ extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of\
    \ Additional Terms\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,\
    \ support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\
    \ Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf\
    \ of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,\
    \ support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You\
    \ hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such\
    \ Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You\
    \ offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of\
    \ liability specific to any jurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute\
    \ or Regulation\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of\
    \ this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,\
    \ judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this\
    \ License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and\
    \ the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included\
    \ with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to\
    \ the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently\
    \ detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n\
    5. Termination\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\
    \ if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\
    \ then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are\
    \ reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and\
    \ finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor\
    \ fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to\
    \ 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from\
    \ a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\
    \ notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first\
    \ time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such\
    \ Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of\
    \ the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting\
    \ a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,\
    \ and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly\
    \ infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors\
    \ for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\
    \n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\
    \ license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly\
    \ granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination\
    \ shall survive termination.\n\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\nCovered Software is\
    \ provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis, without warranty of any kind,\
    \ either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties\
    \ that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular\
    \ purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance\
    \ of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective\
    \ in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,\
    \ repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential\
    \ part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this\
    \ License except under this disclaimer.\n\n7. Limitation of Liability\nUnder no\
    \ circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence),\
    \ contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered\
    \ Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special,\
    \ incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation,\
    \ damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure\
    \ or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such\
    \ party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation\
    \ of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting\
    \ from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\
    \ Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\
    \ consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n\
    \n8. Litigation\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in\
    \ the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place\
    \ of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction,\
    \ without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section\
    \ shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n\
    9. Miscellaneous\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the\
    \ subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,\
    \ such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.\
    \ Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be\
    \ construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against\
    \ a Contributor.\n\n10. Versions of the License\n\n10.1. New Versions\nMozilla\
    \ Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one\
    \ other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions\
    \ of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n\
    \n10.2. Effect of New Versions\nYou may distribute the Covered Software under\
    \ the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received\
    \ the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published\
    \ by the license steward.\n\n10.3. Modified Versions\nIf you create software not\
    \ governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software,\
    \ you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the\
    \ license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except\
    \ to note that such modified license differs from this License).\n\n10.4. Distributing\
    \ Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\nIf You choose\
    \ to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\
    \ under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit\
    \ B of this License must be attached.\n\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License\
    \ Notice\n\nThis Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public\
    \ License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You\

    \ to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a\
    \ location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient\
    \ would be likely to look for such a notice.\n\nYou may add additional accurate\
    \ notices of copyright ownership.\n\nExhibit B - \"Incompatible With Secondary\
    \ Licenses\" Notice\n\nThis Source Code Form is \"Incompatible With Secondary\
