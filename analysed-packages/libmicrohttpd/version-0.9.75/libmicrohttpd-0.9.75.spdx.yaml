    \ 0.9.75\nPlease check \"LicenseComments\" for explanations of concluded licenses\n\
    \nThe license situation concerning the ecos license is not clearly defined, due\
    \ to the following reasons:\n\nIn the COPYING file there is the following information:\n\
    \nSome of this code is DUAL-LICENSED.  If you use MHD without HTTPS/SSL\nsupport,\
    \ you are free to choose between the LGPL and the eCos License\n(http://ecos.sourceware.org/license-overview.html).\
    \  If you compile\nMHD with HTTPS support, you must obey the terms of the GNU\
    \ LGPL.\n\nThis is a vague information. The README states:\n\nGNU libmicrohttpd\
    \ is dual-licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public\nLicense (LGPLv2.1+) and\
    \ the eCos License.  See COPYING for details.\n\n\nlibmicrohttpd-0.9.75/doc/libmicrohttpd.texi\

  extractedText: "Academic Free License (\"AFL\") v. 3.0\n\nThis Academic Free License\
    \ (the \"License\") applies to any original work of authorship (the \"Original\
    \ Work\") whose owner (the \"Licensor\") has placed the following licensing notice\
    \ adjacent to the copyright notice for the Original Work:\n\n     Licensed under\
    \ the Academic Free License version 3.0\n\n1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor\
    \ grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license,\
    \ for the duration of the copyright, to do the following:\n\n     a) to reproduce\
    \ the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a collective work;\n\
    \     b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original\
    \ Work, thereby creating derivative works (\"Derivative Works\") based upon the\
    \ Original Work;\n     c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original\
    \ Work and Derivative Works to the public, under any license of your choice that\
    \ does not contradict the terms and conditions, including Licensor's reserved\
    \ rights and remedies, in this Academic Free License;\n     d) to perform the\
    \ Original Work publicly; and\n     e) to display the Original Work publicly.\n\
    \n2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,\
    \ sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor\
    \ that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the\
    \ duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and\
    \ import the Original Work and Derivative Works.\n\n3) Grant of Source Code License.\
    \ The term \"Source Code\" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making\
    \ modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify\
    \ the Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the\
    \ Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that\
    \ Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation\
    \ by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository\
    \ reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for\
    \ as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work.\n\n 4) Exclusions\
    \ From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors\
    \ to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used\
    \ to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express\
    \ prior permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing\
    \ in this License grants any license to Licensor's trademarks, copyrights, patents,\
    \ trade secrets or any other intellectual property. No patent license is granted\
    \ to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any\
    \ patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license\
    \ is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in\
    \ the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit\
    \ Licensor from licensing under terms different from this License any Original\
    \ Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.\n\n5) External Deployment.\
    \ The term \"External Deployment\" means the use, distribution, or communication\
    \ of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work\
    \ or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works\
    \ are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application\
    \ intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of license\
    \ hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Work\
    \ or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section 1(c).\n\n6) Attribution\
    \ Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You\
    \ create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the Source Code of\
    \ the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text\
    \ identified therein as an \"Attribution Notice.\" You must cause the Source Code\
    \ for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice\
    \ reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original\
    \ Work.\n\n7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants\
    \ that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted\
    \ herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under\
    \ the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those\
    \ copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately\
    \ preceding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an \"\
    AS IS\" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without\
    \ limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for\
    \ a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK\
    \ IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this\
    \ License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License except under\
    \ this disclaimer.\n\n8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under\
    \ no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\
    \ shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental,\
    \ or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License\
    \ or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss\
    \ of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\
    \ other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply\
    \ to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\n\n9) Acceptance and\
    \ Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this License, that assent\
    \ indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its\
    \ terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original\
    \ Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances\
    \ to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. This\
    \ License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section\
    \ 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work,\
    \ and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright\
    \ law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect\
    \ copyright exceptions and limitations (including \"fair use\" or \"fair dealing\"\
    ). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any\
    \ of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the\
    \ conditions in Section 1(c).\n\n10) Termination for Patent Action. This License\
    \ shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights\
    \ granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including\
    \ a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that\
    \ the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply\
    \ for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work\
    \ with other software or hardware.\n\n11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law.\
    \ Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts\
    \ of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts\
    \ its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its\
    \ conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention\
    \ on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any\
    \ use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination\
    \ shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law\
    \ in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination\
    \ of this License.\n\n12) Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms\
    \ of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall\
    \ be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation,\
    \ reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action,\
    \ including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination\
    \ of this License.\n\n13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held\
    \ to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary\
    \ to make it enforceable.\n\n14) Definition of \"You\" in This License. \"You\"\
    \ throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual\
    \ or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms\
    \ of, this License. For legal entities, \"You\" includes any entity that controls,\
    \ is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this\
    \ definition, \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the\
    \ direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or\
    \ (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or\
    \ (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\n\n15) Right to Use. You may use\
    \ the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this\
    \ License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible\
    \ for such uses by You.\n\n16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright\
    \ © 2005 Lawrence Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate\
    \ this License without modification. Nothing in this License permits You to modify\
    \ this License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works. However,\
    \ You may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate\
    \ your modified version (the \"Modified License\") and apply it to other original\
    \ works of authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate\
    \ in any way that your Modified License is the \"Academic Free License\" or \"\
    AFL\" and you may not use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii)\
    \ You must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph above with the\
    \ notice \"Licensed under <insert your license name here>\" or with a notice of\
    \ your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in this License; and\
    \ (iii) You may not claim that your original works are open source software unless\
    \ your Modified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) and\
    \ You comply with its license review and certification process."

    \ software licenses or sets of licenses. Prefixes may be used to indicate the\
    \ number of licenses used, e.g. dual-licensed for software licensed under two\

    \ which terms under which they want to use or distribute the software. The distributor\

    \ (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston,\
    \ MA  02110-1301  USA\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n\
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n0. PREAMBLE\n\nThe\
    \ purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written document\
    \ \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to\
    \ copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially\
    \ or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher\
    \ a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for\
    \ modifications made by others.\n\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which\
    \ means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same\
    \ sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license\
    \ designed for free software.\n\nWe have designed this License in order to use\
    \ it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation:\
    \ a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\
    \ software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be\
    \ used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published\
    \ as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose\
    \ is instruction or reference.\n\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\nThis License\
    \ applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright\
    \ holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. The \"\
    Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public\
    \ is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\".\n\nA \"Modified Version\" of the\
    \ Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied\
    \ verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n\n\
    A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document\
    \ that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of\
    \ the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains\
    \ nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (For example,\
    \ if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may\
    \ not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical\
    \ connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,\
    \ philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\n\nThe \"Invariant\
    \ Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being\
    \ those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released\
    \ under this License.\n\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text\
    \ that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that\
    \ says that the Document is released under this License.\n\nA \"Transparent\"\
    \ copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format\
    \ whose specification is available to the general public, whose contents can be\
    \ viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or\
    \ (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some\
    \ widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters\
    \ or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text\
    \ formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup\
    \ has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers\
    \ is not Transparent. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\"\
    .\n\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without\
    \ markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly\
    \ available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.\
    \ Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read\
    \ and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD\
    \ and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated\
    \ HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\n\nThe \"Title\
    \ Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following\
    \ pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to\
    \ appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page\
    \ as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of\
    \ the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n\n2. VERBATIM\
    \ COPYING\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially\
    \ or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the\
    \ license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in\
    \ all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this\
    \ License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading\
    \ or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept\
    \ compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number\
    \ of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n\nYou may also\
    \ lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display\
    \ copies.\n\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n\nIf you publish printed copies of the Document\
    \ numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,\
    \ you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these\
    \ Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the\
    \ back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher\
    \ of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words\
    \ of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the\
    \ covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they\
    \ preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\
    \ as verbatim copying in other respects.\n\nIf the required texts for either cover\
    \ are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as\
    \ many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\
    \ pages.\n\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\
    \ more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along\
    \ with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible\
    \ computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the Document,\
    \ free of added material, which the general network-using public has access to\
    \ download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network protocols. If\
    \ you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you\
    \ begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent\
    \ copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year\
    \ after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your\
    \ agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\n\nIt is requested, but\
    \ not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing\
    \ any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated\
    \ version of the Document.\n\n4. MODIFICATIONS\n\nYou may copy and distribute\
    \ a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3\
    \ above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License,\
    \ with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\
    \ and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.\
    \ In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n\nA. Use in\
    \ the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the\
    \ Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any,\
    \ be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title\
    \ as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\n\
    B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible\
    \ for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at\
    \ least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors,\
    \ if it has less than five).\nC. State on the Title page the name of the publisher\
    \ of the Modified Version, as the publisher.\nD. Preserve all the copyright notices\
    \ of the Document.\nE. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\
    \ adjacent to the other copyright notices.\nF. Include, immediately after the\
    \ copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the\
    \ Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum\
    \ below.\nG. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\
    \ and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\nH. Include\
    \ an unaltered copy of this License.\nI. Preserve the section entitled \"History\"\
    , and its title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,\
    \ and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is\
    \ no section entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title,\
    \ year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then\
    \ add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.\n\
    J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access\
    \ to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given\
    \ in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in\
    \ the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was\
    \ published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original\
    \ publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\nK. In any section entitled\
    \ \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", preserve the section's title, and preserve\
    \ in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements\
    \ and/or dedications given therein.\nL. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of\
    \ the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or\
    \ the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\nM. Delete any\
    \ section entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the\
    \ Modified Version.\nN. Do not retitle any existing section as \"Endorsements\"\
    \ or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\nIf the Modified Version\
    \ includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections\
    \ and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate\
    \ some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to\
    \ the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These\
    \ titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n\nYou may add a section\
    \ entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of\
    \ your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review\
    \ or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition\
    \ of a standard.\n\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover\
    \ Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the\
    \ list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover\
    \ Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made\
    \ by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same\
    \ cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you\
    \ are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old\
    \ one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n\
    \nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission\
    \ to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any\
    \ Modified Version.\n\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may combine the Document\
    \ with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in\
    \ section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination\
    \ all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified,\
    \ and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license\
    \ notice.\n\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\
    \ multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If\
    \ there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents,\
    \ make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses,\
    \ the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else\
    \ a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list\
    \ of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n\nIn the\
    \ combination, you must combine any sections entitled \"History\" in the various\
    \ original documents, forming one section entitled \"History\"; likewise combine\
    \ any sections entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections entitled \"Dedications\"\
    . You must delete all sections entitled \"Endorsements.\"\n\n6. COLLECTIONS OF\
    \ DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other\
    \ documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of\
    \ this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in\
    \ the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim\
    \ copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n\nYou may extract a\
    \ single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under\
    \ this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted\
    \ document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying\
    \ of that document.\n\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\nA compilation\
    \ of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents\
    \ or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, does not as\
    \ a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation\
    \ copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a compilation is called an \"\
    aggregate\", and this License does not apply to the other self-contained works\
    \ thus compiled with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if\
    \ they are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\n\nIf the Cover Text\
    \ requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then\
    \ if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's\
    \ Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the\
    \ aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.\n\
    \n8. TRANSLATION\n\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\
    \ distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing\
    \ Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their\
    \ copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant\
    \ Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You\
    \ may include a translation of this License provided that you also include the\
    \ original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement between\
    \ the translation and the original English version of this License, the original\
    \ English version will prevail.\n\n9. TERMINATION\n\nYou may not copy, modify,\
    \ sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under\
    \ this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the\
    \ Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\
    \ However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License\
    \ will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full\
    \ compliance.\n\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\nThe Free Software Foundation\
    \ may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from\
    \ time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\
    \ but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n\
    \nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the\
    \ Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any\
    \ later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\
    \ conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has\
    \ been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document\
    \ does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version\
    \ ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n\nHow to\
    \ use this License for your documents\n\nTo use this License in a document you\
    \ have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following\
    \ copyright and license notices just after the title page:\n\n      Copyright\
    \ (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.\n      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or\
    \ modify this document\n      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License,\
    \ Version 1.1\n      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\n\
    \      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\n      Front-Cover\
    \ Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n      A copy of\
    \ the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU\n      Free Documentation\
    \ License\".\nIf you have no Invariant Sections, write \"with no Invariant Sections\"\
    \ instead of saying which ones are invariant. If you have no Front-Cover Texts,\
    \ write \"no Front-Cover Texts\" instead of \"Front-Cover Texts being LIST\";\
    \ likewise for Back-Cover Texts.\n\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples\
    \ of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your\
    \ choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to\
    \ permit their use in free software."

    Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth\
    \ Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute\
    \ verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\
    \   0. PREAMBLE\n\n   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,\
    \ or other functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to\
    \ assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without\
    \ modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License\
    \ preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while\
    \ not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.\n\n   This\
    \ License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the\
    \ document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General\
    \ Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.\n\n\
    \   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software,\
    \ because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with\
    \ manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License\
    \ is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless\
    \ of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend\
    \ this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n\
    \n   1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\n   This License applies to any manual\
    \ or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright\
    \ holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a\
    \ notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to\
    \ use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers\
    \ to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed\
    \ as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work\
    \ in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\n\n   A \"Modified Version\"\
    \ of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either\
    \ copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n\
    \n   A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of\
    \ the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers\
    \ or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related\
    \ matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.\
    \ (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section\
    \ may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical\
    \ connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,\
    \ philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\n\n   The \"Invariant\
    \ Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being\
    \ those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released\
    \ under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary\
    \ then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain\
    \ zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections\
    \ then there are none.\n\n   The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of\
    \ text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice\
    \ that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text\
    \ may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n\n \
    \  A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented\
    \ in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is\
    \ suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors\
    \ or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings)\
    \ some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text\
    \ formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for\
    \ input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format\
    \ whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage\
    \ subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not\
    \ Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"\
    Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\n\n   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent\
    \ copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input\
    \ format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming\
    \ simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of\
    \ transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary\
    \ formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML\
    \ or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available,\
    \ and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors\
    \ for output purposes only.\n\n   The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book,\
    \ the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,\
    \ the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in\
    \ formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text\
    \ near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning\
    \ of the body of the text.\n\n   A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit\
    \ of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses\
    \ following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for\
    \ a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\"\
    , \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section\
    \ when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\"\
    \ according to this definition.\n\n   The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers\
    \ next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These\
    \ Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,\
    \ but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these\
    \ Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this\
    \ License.\n\n   2. VERBATIM COPYING\n\n   You may copy and distribute the Document\
    \ in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License,\
    \ the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to\
    \ the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions\
    \ whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct\
    \ or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.\
    \ However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute\
    \ a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section\
    \ 3.\n\n   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\
    \ you may publicly display copies.\n\n   3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n\n   If you publish\
    \ printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the\
    \ Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires\
    \ Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,\
    \ all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover\
    \ Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\
    \ you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full\
    \ title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add\
    \ other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the\
    \ covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these\
    \ conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\n\n   If the\
    \ required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should\
    \ put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and\
    \ continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\n\n   If you publish or distribute Opaque\
    \ copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable\
    \ Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque\
    \ copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public\
    \ has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent\
    \ copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option,\
    \ you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque\
    \ copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible\
    \ at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute\
    \ an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition\
    \ to the public.\n\n   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the\
    \ authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,\
    \ to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n\
    \n   4. MODIFICATIONS\n\n   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of\
    \ the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you\
    \ release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\
    \ Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification\
    \ of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you\
    \ must do these things in the Modified Version:\n\n      A. Use in the Title Page\
    \ (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and\
    \ from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed\
    \ in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous\
    \ version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\n\n    \
    \  B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible\
    \ for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at\
    \ least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors,\
    \ if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.\n\
    \n      C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version,\
    \ as the publisher.\n\n      D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\n\
    \n      E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent\
    \ to the other copyright notices.\n\n      F. Include, immediately after the copyright\
    \ notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version\
    \ under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\n\n\
    \      G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\
    \ and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\n\n      H.\
    \ Include an unaltered copy of this License.\n\n      I. Preserve the section\
    \ Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least\
    \ the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given\
    \ on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document,\
    \ create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\
    \ given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as\
    \ stated in the previous sentence.\n\n      J. Preserve the network location,\
    \ if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the\
    \ Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous\
    \ versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You\
    \ may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years\
    \ before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers\
    \ to gives permission.\n\n      K. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\"\
    \ or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section\
    \ all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or\
    \ dedications given therein.\n\n      L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of\
    \ the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or\
    \ the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\n\n      M. Delete\
    \ any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in\
    \ the Modified Version.\n\n      N. Do not retitle any existing section to be\
    \ Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\n\
    \n      O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n\n   If the Modified Version includes\
    \ new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and\
    \ contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate\
    \ some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to\
    \ the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These\
    \ titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n\n   You may add a section\
    \ Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of\
    \ your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review\
    \ or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition\
    \ of a standard.\n\n   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover\
    \ Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the\
    \ list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover\
    \ Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made\
    \ by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same\
    \ cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you\
    \ are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old\
    \ one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n\
    \n   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give\
    \ permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement\
    \ of any Modified Version.\n\n   5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\n   You may combine\
    \ the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms\
    \ defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include\
    \ in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,\
    \ unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in\
    \ its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\n\
    \   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple\
    \ identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are\
    \ multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make\
    \ the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses,\
    \ the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else\
    \ a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list\
    \ of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n\n   In the\
    \ combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various\
    \ original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine\
    \ any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\"\
    . You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\".\n\n   6. COLLECTIONS\
    \ OF DOCUMENTS\n\n   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and\
    \ other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies\
    \ of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included\
    \ in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim\
    \ copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n\n   You may extract\
    \ a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under\
    \ this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted\
    \ document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying\
    \ of that document.\n\n   7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\n   A compilation\
    \ of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents\
    \ or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\
    \ \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to\
    \ limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual\
    \ works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does\
    \ not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative\
    \ works of the Document.\n\n   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable\
    \ to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half\
    \ of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers\
    \ that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent\
    \ of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear\
    \ on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n\n   8. TRANSLATION\n\n\
    \   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations\
    \ of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with\
    \ translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you\
    \ may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\
    \ original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation\
    \ of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty\
    \ Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of\
    \ this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In\
    \ case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this\
    \ License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n\n  \
    \ If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\"\
    , or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1)\
    \ will typically require changing the actual title.\n\n   9. TERMINATION\n\n \
    \  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as\
    \ expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,\
    \ sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate\
    \ your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or\
    \ rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated\
    \ so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n   10. FUTURE REVISIONS\
    \ OF THIS LICENSE\n\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised\
    \ versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions\
    \ will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\
    \ address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n\n   Each\
    \ version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document\
    \ specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later\
    \ version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions\
    \ either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published\
    \ (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify\
    \ a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published\
    \ (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. ADDENDUM: How to use this\
    \ License for your documents\n\nTo use this License in a document you have written,\
    \ include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright\
    \ and license notices just after the title page:\n\nCopyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.\
    \ Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under\
    \ the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version\
    \ published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover\
    \ Texts,and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section\
    \ entitled \"GNU Free Documentation License\".\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections,\
    \ Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the \"with...Texts.\" line with\
    \ this:\n\nwith the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover\
    \ Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n\nIf you have Invariant\
    \ Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge\
    \ those two alternatives to suit the situation.\n\nIf your document contains nontrivial\
    \ examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel\
    \ under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,\
    \ to permit their use in free software."

    \nCopyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n\
    \nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license\
    \ document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n0. PREAMBLE\nThe purpose of this\
    \ License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document\
    \ \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to\
    \ copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially\
    \ or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher\
    \ a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for\
    \ modifications made by others.\n\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which\
    \ means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same\
    \ sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license\
    \ designed for free software.\n\nWe have designed this License in order to use\
    \ it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation:\
    \ a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\
    \ software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be\
    \ used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published\
    \ as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose\
    \ is instruction or reference.\n\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\nThis License\
    \ applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed\
    \ by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this\
    \ License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited\
    \ in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\"\
    , below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee,\
    \ and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute\
    \ the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\n\nA \"Modified\
    \ Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion\
    \ of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into\
    \ another language.\n\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter\
    \ section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\
    \ publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or\
    \ to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that\
    \ overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,\
    \ a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could\
    \ be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters,\
    \ or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\
    \ them.\n\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\
    \ are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says\
    \ that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit\
    \ the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as\
    \ Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document\
    \ does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\n\nThe \"Cover\
    \ Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts\
    \ or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under\
    \ this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text\
    \ may be at most 25 words.\n\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable\
    \ copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general\
    \ public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic\
    \ text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for\
    \ drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input\
    \ to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable\
    \ for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format\
    \ whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage\
    \ subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not\
    \ Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"\
    Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\n\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent\
    \ copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input\
    \ format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming\
    \ simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of\
    \ transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary\
    \ formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML\
    \ or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available,\
    \ and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors\
    \ for output purposes only.\n\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the\
    \ title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,\
    \ the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in\
    \ formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text\
    \ near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning\
    \ of the body of the text.\n\nThe \"publisher\" means any person or entity that\
    \ distributes copies of the Document to the public.\n\nA section \"Entitled XYZ\"\
    \ means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or\
    \ contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language.\
    \ (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\"\
    , \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\"\
    \ of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section\
    \ \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition.\n\nThe Document may include Warranty\
    \ Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the\
    \ Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference\
    \ in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication\
    \ that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning\
    \ of this License.\n\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\nYou may copy and distribute the Document\
    \ in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License,\
    \ the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to\
    \ the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions\
    \ whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct\
    \ or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.\
    \ However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute\
    \ a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section\
    \ 3.\n\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\
    \ you may publicly display copies.\n\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\nIf you publish printed\
    \ copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document,\
    \ numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,\
    \ you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these\
    \ Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the\
    \ back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher\
    \ of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words\
    \ of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the\
    \ covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they\
    \ preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\
    \ as verbatim copying in other respects.\n\nIf the required texts for either cover\
    \ are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as\
    \ many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\
    \ pages.\n\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\
    \ more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along\
    \ with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network\
    \ location from which the general network-using public has access to download\
    \ using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document,\
    \ free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably\
    \ prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to\
    \ ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated\
    \ location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque\
    \ copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\n\
    \nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document\
    \ well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance\
    \ to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n\n4. MODIFICATIONS\n\
    You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions\
    \ of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under\
    \ precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document,\
    \ thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever\
    \ possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified\
    \ Version:\n\nA. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\
    \ from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should,\
    \ if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may\
    \ use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version\
    \ gives permission.\nB. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons\
    \ or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\
    \ Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document\
    \ (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release\
    \ you from this requirement.\nC. State on the Title page the name of the publisher\
    \ of the Modified Version, as the publisher.\nD. Preserve all the copyright notices\
    \ of the Document.\nE. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\
    \ adjacent to the other copyright notices.\nF. Include, immediately after the\
    \ copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the\
    \ Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum\
    \ below.\nG. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\
    \ and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\nH. Include\
    \ an unaltered copy of this License.\nI. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\"\
    , Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year,\
    \ new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.\
    \ If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating\
    \ the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title\
    \ Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous\
    \ sentence.\nJ. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\
    \ public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network\
    \ locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These\
    \ may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for\
    \ a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or\
    \ if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\nK.\
    \ For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the\
    \ Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone\
    \ of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.\n\
    L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text\
    \ and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part\
    \ of the section titles.\nM. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such\
    \ a section may not be included in the Modified Version.\nN. Do not retitle any\
    \ existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with\
    \ any Invariant Section.\nO. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\nIf the Modified\
    \ Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary\
    \ Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option\
    \ designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their\
    \ titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.\
    \ These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n\nYou may add\
    \ a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements\
    \ of your Modified Version by various parties—for example, statements of peer\
    \ review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative\
    \ definition of a standard.\n\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a\
    \ Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the\
    \ end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of\
    \ Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements\
    \ made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the\
    \ same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity\
    \ you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the\
    \ old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old\
    \ one.\n\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\
    \ give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement\
    \ of any Modified Version.\n\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\nYou may combine the Document\
    \ with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in\
    \ section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination\
    \ all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified,\
    \ and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license\
    \ notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nThe combined\
    \ work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant\
    \ Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant\
    \ Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such\
    \ section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\
    \ author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make\
    \ the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections\
    \ in the license notice of the combined work.\n\nIn the combination, you must\
    \ combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents,\
    \ forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled\
    \ \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete\
    \ all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\".\n\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\nYou\
    \ may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released\
    \ under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the\
    \ various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided\
    \ that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the\
    \ documents in all other respects.\n\nYou may extract a single document from such\
    \ a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you\
    \ insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License\
    \ in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n\n7. AGGREGATION\
    \ WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with\
    \ other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage\
    \ or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting\
    \ from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's\
    \ users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included\
    \ in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate\
    \ which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\n\nIf the Cover Text\
    \ requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then\
    \ if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's\
    \ Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate,\
    \ or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.\
    \ Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n\
    \n8. TRANSLATION\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\
    \ distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing\
    \ Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their\
    \ copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant\
    \ Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You\
    \ may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the\
    \ Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original\
    \ English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and\
    \ disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original\
    \ version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will\
    \ prevail.\n\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"\
    Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title\
    \ (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.\n\n9. TERMINATION\n\
    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly\
    \ provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,\
    \ or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\
    \ this License.\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\
    \ license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\
    \ unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your\
    \ license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of\
    \ the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\
    \nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently\
    \ if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means,\
    \ this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License\
    \ (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior\
    \ to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under\
    \ this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies\
    \ or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and\
    \ not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material\
    \ does not give you any rights to use it.\n\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\
    The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free\
    \ Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in\
    \ spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\
    \ or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n\nEach version of the License\
    \ is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular\
    \ numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you\
    \ have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified\
    \ version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by\
    \ the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number\
    \ of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft)\
    \ by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can\
    \ decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public\
    \ statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that\
    \ version for the Document.\n\n11. RELICENSING\n\"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration\
    \ Site\" (or \"MMC Site\") means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable\
    \ works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.\
    \ A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A \"Massive\
    \ Multiauthor Collaboration\" (or \"MMC\") contained in the site means any set\
    \ of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.\n\n\"CC-BY-SA\" means\
    \ the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative\
    \ Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of\
    \ business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of\
    \ that license published by that same organization.\n\n\"Incorporate\" means to\
    \ publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.\n\
    \nAn MMC is \"eligible for relicensing\" if it is licensed under this License,\
    \ and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other\
    \ than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC,\
    \ (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated\
    \ prior to November 1, 2008.\n\nThe operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC\

    \nCopyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n\
    \nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license\
    \ document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n0. PREAMBLE\nThe purpose of this\
    \ License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document\
    \ \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to\
    \ copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially\
    \ or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher\
    \ a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for\
    \ modifications made by others.\n\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which\
    \ means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same\
    \ sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license\
    \ designed for free software.\n\nWe have designed this License in order to use\
    \ it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation:\
    \ a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\
    \ software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be\
    \ used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published\
    \ as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose\
    \ is instruction or reference.\n\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\nThis License\
    \ applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed\
    \ by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this\
    \ License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited\
    \ in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\"\
    , below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee,\
    \ and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute\
    \ the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\n\nA \"Modified\
    \ Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion\
    \ of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into\
    \ another language.\n\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter\
    \ section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\
    \ publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or\
    \ to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that\
    \ overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,\
    \ a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could\
    \ be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters,\
    \ or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\
    \ them.\n\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\
    \ are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says\
    \ that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit\
    \ the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as\
    \ Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document\
    \ does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\n\nThe \"Cover\
    \ Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts\
    \ or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under\
    \ this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text\
    \ may be at most 25 words.\n\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable\
    \ copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general\
    \ public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic\
    \ text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for\
    \ drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input\
    \ to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable\
    \ for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format\
    \ whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage\
    \ subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not\
    \ Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"\
    Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\n\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent\
    \ copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input\
    \ format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming\
    \ simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of\
    \ transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary\
    \ formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML\
    \ or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available,\
    \ and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors\
    \ for output purposes only.\n\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the\
    \ title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,\
    \ the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in\
    \ formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text\
    \ near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning\
    \ of the body of the text.\n\nThe \"publisher\" means any person or entity that\
    \ distributes copies of the Document to the public.\n\nA section \"Entitled XYZ\"\
    \ means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or\
    \ contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language.\
    \ (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\"\
    , \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\"\
    \ of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section\
    \ \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition.\n\nThe Document may include Warranty\
    \ Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the\
    \ Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference\
    \ in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication\
    \ that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning\
    \ of this License.\n\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\nYou may copy and distribute the Document\
    \ in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License,\
    \ the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to\
    \ the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions\
    \ whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct\
    \ or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.\
    \ However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute\
    \ a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section\
    \ 3.\n\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\
    \ you may publicly display copies.\n\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\nIf you publish printed\
    \ copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document,\
    \ numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,\
    \ you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these\
    \ Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the\
    \ back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher\
    \ of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words\
    \ of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the\
    \ covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they\
    \ preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\
    \ as verbatim copying in other respects.\n\nIf the required texts for either cover\
    \ are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as\
    \ many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\
    \ pages.\n\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\
    \ more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along\
    \ with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network\
    \ location from which the general network-using public has access to download\
    \ using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document,\
    \ free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably\
    \ prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to\
    \ ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated\
    \ location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque\
    \ copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\n\
    \nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document\
    \ well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance\
    \ to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n\n4. MODIFICATIONS\n\
    You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions\
    \ of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under\
    \ precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document,\
    \ thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever\
    \ possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified\
    \ Version:\n\nA. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\
    \ from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should,\
    \ if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may\
    \ use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version\
    \ gives permission.\nB. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons\
    \ or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\
    \ Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document\
    \ (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release\
    \ you from this requirement.\nC. State on the Title page the name of the publisher\
    \ of the Modified Version, as the publisher.\nD. Preserve all the copyright notices\
    \ of the Document.\nE. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\
    \ adjacent to the other copyright notices.\nF. Include, immediately after the\
    \ copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the\
    \ Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum\
    \ below.\nG. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\
    \ and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\nH. Include\
    \ an unaltered copy of this License.\nI. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\"\
    , Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year,\
    \ new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.\
    \ If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating\
    \ the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title\
    \ Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous\
    \ sentence.\nJ. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\
    \ public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network\
    \ locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These\
    \ may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for\
    \ a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or\
    \ if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\nK.\
    \ For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the\
    \ Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone\
    \ of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.\n\
    L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text\
    \ and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part\
    \ of the section titles.\nM. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such\
    \ a section may not be included in the Modified Version.\nN. Do not retitle any\
    \ existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with\
    \ any Invariant Section.\nO. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\nIf the Modified\
    \ Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary\
    \ Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option\
    \ designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their\
    \ titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.\
    \ These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n\nYou may add\
    \ a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements\
    \ of your Modified Version by various parties—for example, statements of peer\
    \ review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative\
    \ definition of a standard.\n\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a\
    \ Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the\
    \ end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of\
    \ Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements\
    \ made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the\
    \ same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity\
    \ you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the\
    \ old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old\
    \ one.\n\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\
    \ give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement\
    \ of any Modified Version.\n\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\nYou may combine the Document\
    \ with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in\
    \ section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination\
    \ all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified,\
    \ and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license\
    \ notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nThe combined\
    \ work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant\
    \ Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant\
    \ Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such\
    \ section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\
    \ author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make\
    \ the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections\
    \ in the license notice of the combined work.\n\nIn the combination, you must\
    \ combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents,\
    \ forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled\
    \ \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete\
    \ all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\".\n\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\nYou\
    \ may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released\
    \ under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the\
    \ various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided\
    \ that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the\
    \ documents in all other respects.\n\nYou may extract a single document from such\
    \ a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you\
    \ insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License\
    \ in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n\n7. AGGREGATION\
    \ WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with\
    \ other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage\
    \ or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting\
    \ from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's\
    \ users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included\
    \ in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate\
    \ which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\n\nIf the Cover Text\
    \ requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then\
    \ if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's\
    \ Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate,\
    \ or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.\
    \ Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n\
    \n8. TRANSLATION\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\
    \ distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing\
    \ Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their\
    \ copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant\
    \ Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You\
    \ may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the\
    \ Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original\
    \ English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and\
    \ disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original\
    \ version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will\
    \ prevail.\n\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"\
    Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title\
    \ (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.\n\n9. TERMINATION\n\
    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly\
    \ provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,\
    \ or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\
    \ this License.\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\
    \ license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\
    \ unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your\
    \ license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of\
    \ the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\
    \nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently\
    \ if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means,\
    \ this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License\
    \ (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior\
    \ to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under\
    \ this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies\
    \ or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and\
    \ not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material\
    \ does not give you any rights to use it.\n\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\
    The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free\
    \ Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in\
    \ spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\
    \ or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n\nEach version of the License\
    \ is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular\
    \ numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you\
    \ have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified\
    \ version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by\
    \ the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number\
    \ of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft)\
    \ by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can\
    \ decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public\
    \ statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that\
    \ version for the Document.\n\n11. RELICENSING\n\"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration\
    \ Site\" (or \"MMC Site\") means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable\
    \ works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.\
    \ A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A \"Massive\
    \ Multiauthor Collaboration\" (or \"MMC\") contained in the site means any set\
    \ of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.\n\n\"CC-BY-SA\" means\
    \ the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative\
    \ Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of\
    \ business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of\
    \ that license published by that same organization.\n\n\"Incorporate\" means to\
    \ publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.\n\
    \nAn MMC is \"eligible for relicensing\" if it is licensed under this License,\
    \ and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other\
    \ than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC,\
    \ (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated\
    \ prior to November 1, 2008.\n\nThe operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC\
    \ contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August\
    \ 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing."

    \ (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston,\
    \ MA 02110-1301 USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\
    \ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe\
    \ license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the mercy\
    \ of those companies. By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee\
    \ your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is\
    \ free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software\
    \ Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using\
    \ it. You can use it for your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software,\
    \ we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public License\
    \ is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies\
    \ of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,\
    \ that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and\
    \ that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to\
    \ make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you\
    \ to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities\
    \ for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor\
    \ example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for\
    \ a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make\
    \ sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them\
    \ their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,\
    \ and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\
    \ and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours,\
    \ we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty\
    \ for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed\
    \ on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,\
    \ so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'\
    \ reputations.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\
    \ modification follow.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR\
    \ COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n   0. This License Agreement applies\
    \ to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright\
    \ holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.\
    \ The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based\
    \ on the Program\" means either the Program or any work containing the Program\
    \ or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is\
    \ addressed as \"you\".\n\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of\
    \ the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\
    \ conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\
    \ this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any\
    \ other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along\
    \ with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring\
    \ a copy.\n\n   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\
    \ of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph\
    \ 1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n\n      a) cause the modified\
    \ files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the\
    \ date of any change; and\n\n      b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute\
    \ or publish, that in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof,\
    \ either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third\
    \ parties under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may\
    \ choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).\n\
    \n      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\
    \ run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the\
    \ simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an\
    \ appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else,\
    \ saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program\
    \ under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General\
    \ Public License.\n\n      d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring\
    \ a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for\
    \ a fee.\n\n   Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or\
    \ its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\
    \ the other work under the scope of these terms.\n\n   3. You may copy and distribute\
    \ the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object\
    \ code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided\
    \ that you also do one of the following:\n\n      a) accompany it with the complete\
    \ corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under\
    \ the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n      b) accompany it with a written\
    \ offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party free (except\
    \ for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable\
    \ copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\
    \ Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n      c) accompany it with the information\
    \ you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained. (This\
    \ alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received\
    \ the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n\n   Source code for\
    \ a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.\
    \ For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all\
    \ modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source\
    \ code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system\
    \ on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions\
    \ files that accompany that operating system.\n\n   4. You may not copy, modify,\
    \ sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided\
    \ under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,\
    \ distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\
    \ your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have\
    \ received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public\
    \ License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain\
    \ in full compliance.\n\n   5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license\
    \ to do so, and all its terms and conditions.\n\n   6. Each time you redistribute\
    \ the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically\
    \ receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify\
    \ the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\
    \ restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\n \
    \  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\
    \ the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar\
    \ in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\
    \ or concerns.\n\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If\
    \ the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and\
    \ \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\
    \ either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license,\
    \ you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\
    \n   8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\
    \ whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\
    \ permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\
    \ write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\
    \ Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\
    \ all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse\
    \ of software generally.\n\n   NO WARRANTY\n\n   9.\n\n   BECAUSE THE PROGRAM\
    \ IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT\
    \ PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\
    \ HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\
    \ OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\
    \ IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\
    \ THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.\
    \ SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\
    \ REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW\
    \ OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY\
    \ MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\
    \ FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\
    \ ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\
    \ TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU\
    \ OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\
    \ EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\
    \ DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAppendix: How to Apply These Terms to\
    \ Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of\
    \ the greatest possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make\
    \ it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\
    \nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach\
    \ them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion\
    \ of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\
    \ pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n<one line to give the program's\
    \ name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n\nCopyright (C) 19yy <name of author>\n\

    Preamble\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\nHow\
    \ to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nVersion\
    \ 2, June 1991\n\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  \n\
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted\
    \ to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing\
    \ it is not allowed.\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed\
    \ to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General\
    \ Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\
    \ software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General\
    \ Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and\
    \ to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software\
    \ Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)\
    \ You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we\
    \ are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed\
    \ to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software\
    \ (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can\
    \ get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\
    \ in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect\
    \ your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these\
    \ rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to\
    \ certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or\
    \ if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program,\
    \ whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\
    \ you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.\
    \ And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect\
    \ your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this\
    \ license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the\
    \ software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\
    \ that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.\
    \ If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients\
    \ to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced\
    \ by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally,\
    \ any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid\
    \ the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent\
    \ licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have\
    \ made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not\
    \ licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution\
    \ and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND\
    \ MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\
    \ a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the\
    \ terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any\
    \ such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program\
    \ or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing\
    \ the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\
    \ translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without\
    \ limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\"\
    .\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered\
    \ by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program\
    \ is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\
    \ constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running\
    \ the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You\
    \ may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\
    \ receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\
    \ publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;\
    \ keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of\
    \ any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\
    \ along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring\
    \ a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for\
    \ a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\
    \ of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such\
    \ modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you\
    \ also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) You must cause the modified files to\
    \ carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any\
    \ change.\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\
    \ whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,\
    \ to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms\
    \ of this License.\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\
    \ when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in\
    \ the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate\
    \ copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that\
    \ you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\
    \ conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception:\
    \ if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,\
    \ your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections\
    \ of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered\
    \ independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,\
    \ do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But\
    \ when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\
    \ on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,\
    \ whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to\
    \ each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent\
    \ of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely\
    \ by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution\
    \ of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere\
    \ aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with\
    \ a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium\
    \ does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n\n3. You may\
    \ copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in\
    \ object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided\
    \ that you also do one of the following:\n\na) Accompany it with the complete\
    \ corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under\
    \ the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\
    \ interchange; or,\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\
    \ years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically\
    \ performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding\
    \ source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on\
    \ a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\nc) Accompany it with\
    \ the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source\
    \ code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only\
    \ if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer,\
    \ in accord with Subsection b above.)\nThe source code for a work means the preferred\
    \ form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete\
    \ source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\
    \ associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\
    \ and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source\
    \ code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in\
    \ either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and\
    \ so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\
    \ itself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object\
    \ code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering\
    \ equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution\
    \ of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the\
    \ source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense,\
    \ or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any\
    \ attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void,\
    \ and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties\
    \ who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have\
    \ their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\
    \n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\
    \ However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program\
    \ or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept\
    \ this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work\
    \ based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,\
    \ and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the\
    \ Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or\
    \ any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license\
    \ from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject\
    \ to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on\
    \ the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible\
    \ for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence\
    \ of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason\
    \ (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
    \ order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
    \ they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\
    \ so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\
    \ other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\
    \ Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\
    \ redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly\
    \ through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\
    \ be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of\
    \ this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,\
    \ the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is\
    \ intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section\
    \ to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest\
    \ validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting\
    \ the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\
    \ by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to\
    \ the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent\
    \ application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or\
    \ she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee\
    \ cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear\
    \ what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the\
    \ distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either\
    \ by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places\
    \ the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution\
    \ limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only\
    \ in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\
    \ the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software\
    \ Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License\
    \ from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present\
    \ version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach\
    \ version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a\
    \ version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\
    \ does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version\
    \ ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate\
    \ parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions\
    \ are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which\
    \ is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\
    \n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\
    \ THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE\
    \ WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\
    \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to\
    \ Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and\

    \ patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\
    \ individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.\
    \ To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for\
    \ everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions\
    \ for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR\
    \ COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n   0. This License applies to any\
    \ program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder\
    \ saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.\
    \ The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based\
    \ on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright\
    \ law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\
    \ verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,\
    \ translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each\
    \ licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n   Activities other than copying, distribution\
    \ and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.\
    \ The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\
    \ is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent\
    \ of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on\
    \ what the Program does.\n\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies\
    \ of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\
    \ you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\
    \ this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients\
    \ of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n   You may\
    \ charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your\
    \ option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n   2. You may modify\
    \ your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work\
    \ based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under\
    \ the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\
    \n      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\
    \ that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n      b) You must\
    \ cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains\
    \ or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole\
    \ at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n     \
    \ c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you\
    \ must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary\
    \ way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\
    \ a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions,\
    \ and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the\
    \ Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,\
    \ your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\n\
    \   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\
    \ sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\
    \ considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,\
    \ and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\
    \ works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is\
    \ a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\
    \ of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\
    \ whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\n   Thus,\
    \ it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights\
    \ to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right\
    \ to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\n\
    \n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with\
    \ the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\
    \ distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n\
    \n   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\
    \ Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\
    \ 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n      a) Accompany\
    \ it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must\
    \ be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily\
    \ used for software interchange; or,\n\n      b) Accompany it with a written offer,\
    \ valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more\
    \ than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable\
    \ copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\
    \ Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;\
    \ or,\n\n      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\
    \ to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for\
    \ noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code\
    \ or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\
    \n   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\
    \ modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all\
    \ the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition\
    \ files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the\
    \ executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need\
    \ not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\
    \ form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating\
    \ system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\
    \ the executable.\n\n   If distribution of executable or object code is made by\
    \ offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access\
    \ to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source\
    \ code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with\
    \ the object code.\n\n   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute\
    \ the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\
    \ to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\
    \ copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\
    \ terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n   5. You are\
    \ not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,\
    \ nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its\
    \ derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this\
    \ License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based\
    \ on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\
    \ all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ or works based on it.\n\n   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any\
    \ work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from\
    \ the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\
    \ terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\
    \ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\
    \ compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n   7. If, as a consequence of\
    \ a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason\
    \ (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
    \ order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
    \ they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\
    \ so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\
    \ other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\
    \ Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\
    \ redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly\
    \ through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\
    \ be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\n   If any portion\
    \ of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,\
    \ the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is\
    \ intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\n   It is not the purpose of this\
    \ section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims\
    \ or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose\
    \ of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which\
    \ is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions\
    \ to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on\
    \ consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide\
    \ if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and\
    \ a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\n   This section is intended to make\
    \ thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\
    \n   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\
    \ countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright\
    \ holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical\
    \ distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted\
    \ only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\
    \ the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n   9. The Free\
    \ Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public\
    \ License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the\
    \ present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\
    \n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies\
    \ a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\
    \ does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version\
    \ ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   10. If you wish to incorporate\
    \ parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions\
    \ are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which\
    \ is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n   NO WARRANTY\n\
    \n   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\
    \ FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE\
    \ WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\
    \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply\
    \ These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want\
    \ it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve\
    \ this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change\
    \ under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.\
    \ It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\
    \ convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"\
    copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n<one line\
    \ to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.>\n\nCopyright (C) <yyyy>\
    \ <name of author>\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\
    \ modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\
    \ the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)\
    \ any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be\
    \ useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY\
    \ or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for\
    \ more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\
    \ along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\
    \ 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.\n\nAlso add information\
    \ on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive,\
    \ make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\
    \nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes\
    \ with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software,\
    \ and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show\
    \ c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show\
    \ the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands\
    \ you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could\
    \ even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should\
    \ also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any,\
    \ to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here is a\
    \ sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest\

    \ copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it\
    \ is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to\
    \ take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General\
    \ Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\
    \ software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General\
    \ Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and\
    \ to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software\
    \ Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)\
    \ You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we\
    \ are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed\
    \ to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software\
    \ (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can\
    \ get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\
    \ in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect\
    \ your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these\
    \ rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to\
    \ certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or\
    \ if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program,\
    \ whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\
    \ you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.\
    \ And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect\
    \ your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this\
    \ license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the\
    \ software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\
    \ that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.\
    \ If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients\
    \ to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced\
    \ by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally,\
    \ any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid\
    \ the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent\
    \ licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have\
    \ made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not\
    \ licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution\
    \ and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND\
    \ MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\
    \ a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the\
    \ terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any\
    \ such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program\
    \ or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing\
    \ the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\
    \ translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without\
    \ limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\"\
    .\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered\
    \ by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program\
    \ is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\
    \ constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running\
    \ the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You\
    \ may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\
    \ receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\
    \ publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;\
    \ keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of\
    \ any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\
    \ along with the Program.\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring\
    \ a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for\
    \ a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\
    \ of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such\
    \ modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you\
    \ also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) You must cause the modified files to\
    \ carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any\
    \ change.\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\
    \ whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,\
    \ to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms\
    \ of this License.\n\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\
    \ when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in\
    \ the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate\
    \ copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that\
    \ you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\
    \ conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception:\
    \ if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,\
    \ your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\n\
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections\
    \ of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered\
    \ independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,\
    \ do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But\
    \ when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\
    \ on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,\
    \ whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to\
    \ each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent\
    \ of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely\
    \ by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution\
    \ of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere\
    \ aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with\
    \ a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium\
    \ does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n\n3. You may\
    \ copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in\
    \ object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided\
    \ that you also do one of the following:\n\na) Accompany it with the complete\
    \ corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under\
    \ the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\
    \ interchange; or,\n\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least\
    \ three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of\
    \ physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy\
    \ of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections\
    \ 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n\
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute\
    \ corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial\
    \ distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable\
    \ form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code\
    \ for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to\
    \ it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for\
    \ all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus\
    \ the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.\
    \ However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include\
    \ anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with\
    \ the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\
    \ which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\n\
    \nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\
    \ from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source\
    \ code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though\
    \ third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\
    \n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\
    \ expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\
    \ sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\
    \ your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or\
    \ rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated\
    \ so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required\
    \ to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else\
    \ grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative\
    \ works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.\
    \ Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\
    \ Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its\
    \ terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works\
    \ based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based\
    \ on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original\
    \ licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and\
    \ conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise\
    \ of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance\
    \ by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment\
    \ or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to\
    \ patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement\
    \ or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse\
    \ you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\
    \ simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,\
    \ then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example,\
    \ if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program\
    \ by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the\
    \ only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely\
    \ from distribution of the Program.\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid\
    \ or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section\
    \ is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\
    \ circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe\
    \ any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such\
    \ claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the\

    \ is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of\
    \ the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program\
    \ is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,\
    \ the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may\
    \ add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\
    \ so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.\
    \ In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the\
    \ body of this License.\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or\
    \ new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions\
    \ will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\
    \ address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version\

    \ to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms\
    \ and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the\
    \ Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of\

    \ do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them\

    \ (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor,\
    \ Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim\
    \ copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\nPreamble\n\
    \nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share\
    \ and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee\
    \ your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is\
    \ free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free\
    \ Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit\
    \ to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the\
    \ GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs,\
    \ too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\
    \ Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom\
    \ to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\
    \ that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\
    \ the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you\
    \ can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions\
    \ that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\
    \ These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute\
    \ copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute\
    \ copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients\
    \ all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or\
    \ can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their\
    \ rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,\
    \ and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\
    \ and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours,\
    \ we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty\
    \ for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed\
    \ on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,\
    \ so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'\
    \ reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\
    \ patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\
    \ individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.\
    \ To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for\
    \ everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions\
    \ for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR\
    \ COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program\
    \ or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying\
    \ it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"\
    Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the\
    \ Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\
    \ that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim\
    \ or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,\
    \ translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each\
    \ licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution\
    \ and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.\
    \ The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\
    \ is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent\
    \ of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on\
    \ what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of\
    \ the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\
    \ conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\
    \ this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients\
    \ of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge\
    \ a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option\
    \ offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy\
    \ or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on\
    \ the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms\
    \ of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n\
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you\
    \ changed the files and the date of any change.\nb) You must cause any work that\
    \ you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from\
    \ the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all\
    \ third parties under the terms of this License.\nc) If the modified program normally\
    \ reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running\
    \ for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement\
    \ including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty\
    \ (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute\
    \ the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy\
    \ of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not\
    \ normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required\
    \ to print an announcement.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as\
    \ a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\
    \ and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves,\
    \ then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute\
    \ them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of\
    \ a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole\
    \ must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees\
    \ extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who\
    \ wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\
    \ your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise\
    \ the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based\
    \ on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on\
    \ the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume\
    \ of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\
    \ scope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work\
    \ based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms\
    \ of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n\
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,\
    \ which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\
    \ customarily used for software interchange; or,\nb) Accompany it with a written\
    \ offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge\
    \ no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\
    \ machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under\
    \ the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\
    \ interchange; or,\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the\
    \ offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\
    \ only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\
    \ object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection\
    \ b above.)\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\
    \ making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means\
    \ all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\
    \ definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\
    \ of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed\
    \ need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or\
    \ binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\
    \ operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself\
    \ accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code\
    \ is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\
    \ access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of\
    \ the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\
    \ along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute\
    \ the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\
    \ to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\
    \ copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\
    \ terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are\
    \ not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,\
    \ nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its\
    \ derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this\
    \ License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based\
    \ on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\
    \ all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work\
    \ based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\
    \ original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\
    \ terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\
    \ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\
    \ compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a\
    \ court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason\
    \ (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
    \ order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
    \ they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\
    \ so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\
    \ other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\
    \ Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\
    \ redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly\
    \ through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\
    \ be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of\
    \ this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,\
    \ the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is\
    \ intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section\
    \ to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest\
    \ validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting\
    \ the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\
    \ by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to\
    \ the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent\
    \ application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or\
    \ she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee\
    \ cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear\
    \ what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the\
    \ distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either\
    \ by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places\
    \ the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution\
    \ limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only\
    \ in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\
    \ the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software\
    \ Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License\
    \ from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present\
    \ version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach\
    \ version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a\
    \ version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\
    \ does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version\
    \ ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate\
    \ parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions\
    \ are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which\
    \ is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\
    \n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\
    \ THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE\
    \ WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\
    \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to\
    \ Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and\
    \ you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to\
    \ achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and\
    \ change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.\

    \ applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply\

    \ to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure\

    \ of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom\
    \ of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\
    \ gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that\
    \ you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\
    \ code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers\
    \ that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright\
    \ on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission\
    \ to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers' and authors' protection,\
    \ the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For\
    \ both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked\
    \ as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors\
    \ of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install\
    \ or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\
    \ can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users'\
    \ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs\
    \ in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it\
    \ is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to\
    \ prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially\
    \ in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in\
    \ future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally,\
    \ every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not\
    \ allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose\
    \ computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents\
    \ applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent\
    \ this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\
    \nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n0. Definitions.\n\n\"This License\" refers\
    \ to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n\"Copyright\" also means\
    \ copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor\
    \ masks.\n\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\
    \ License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\"\
    \ may be individuals or organizations.\n\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from\
    \ or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission,\
    \ other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified\
    \ version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\nA\
    \ \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the\
    \ Program.\n\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\
    \ permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under\
    \ applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private\
    \ copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),\
    \ making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\
    \nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties\
    \ to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network,\
    \ with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface\
    \ displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient\
    \ and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice,\
    \ and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\
    \ extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under\
    \ this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents\
    \ a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the\
    \ list meets this criterion.\n\n1. Source Code.\nThe \"source code\" for a work\
    \ means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \"Object\
    \ code\" means any non-source form of a work.\n\nA \"Standard Interface\" means\
    \ an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards\
    \ body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language,\
    \ one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\nThe \"\
    System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work\
    \ as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component,\
    \ but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable\
    \ use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface\
    \ for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.\
    \ A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel,\
    \ window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which\
    \ the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object\
    \ code interpreter used to run it.\n\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work\
    \ in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and\
    \ (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including\
    \ scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's\
    \ System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs\
    \ which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part\
    \ of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition\
    \ files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared\
    \ libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed\
    \ to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\
    \ subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not\
    \ include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of\
    \ the Corresponding Source.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code\
    \ form is that same work.\n\n2. Basic Permissions.\nAll rights granted under this\
    \ License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable\
    \ provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your\
    \ unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running\
    \ a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content,\
    \ constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use\
    \ or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\nYou may make, run and\
    \ propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as\
    \ your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others\
    \ for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you,\
    \ or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply\
    \ with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not\
    \ control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must\
    \ do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms\
    \ that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside\
    \ their relationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted\
    \ solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section\
    \ 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention\
    \ Law.\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure\
    \ under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO\
    \ copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or\
    \ restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work,\
    \ you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures\
    \ to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this\
    \ License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to\
    \ limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against\
    \ the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention\
    \ of technological measures.\n\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\nYou may convey\
    \ verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,\
    \ provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\
    \ copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\
    \ non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep\
    \ intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a\
    \ copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge any price or\
    \ no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty\
    \ protection for a fee.\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\nYou may convey\
    \ a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program,\
    \ in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also\
    \ meet all of these conditions:\n\n     a) The work must carry prominent notices\
    \ stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n     b) The work\
    \ must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License\
    \ and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement\
    \ in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n     c) You must license the\
    \ entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession\
    \ of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section\
    \ 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless\
    \ of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work\
    \ in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately\
    \ received it.\n\n     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must\
    \ display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces\
    \ that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them\
    \ do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\
    \ works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which\
    \ are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume\
    \ of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation\
    \ and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights\
    \ of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion\
    \ of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the\
    \ other parts of the aggregate.\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\nYou may convey\
    \ a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided\
    \ that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms\
    \ of this License, in one of these ways:\n\n     a) Convey the object code in,\
    \ or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium),\
    \ accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily\
    \ used for software interchange.\n\n     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied\
    \ in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied\
    \ by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as\
    \ you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone\
    \ who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source\
    \ for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable\
    \ physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more\
    \ than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source,\
    \ or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\
    \n     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written\
    \ offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only\
    \ occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with\
    \ such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n\n     d) Convey the object code\
    \ by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer\
    \ equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same\
    \ place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding\
    \ Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a\
    \ network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated\
    \ by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided\
    \ you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\
    \ Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source,\
    \ you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to\
    \ satisfy these requirements.\n\n     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer\
    \ transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\
    \ Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under\
    \ subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code\
    \ is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included\
    \ in conveying the object code work.\n\nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"\
    consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally\
    \ used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or\
    \ sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is\
    \ a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For\
    \ a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers\
    \ to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\
    \ of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,\
    \ or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product\
    \ regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or\
    \ non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use\
    \ of the product.\n\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any\
    \ methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\
    \ and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a\
    \ modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to\
    \ ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case\
    \ prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n\n\
    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically\
    \ for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction\
    \ in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred\
    \ to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction\
    \ is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must\
    \ be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not\
    \ apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified\
    \ object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in\
    \ ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include\
    \ a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for\
    \ a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User\
    \ Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may\
    \ be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the\
    \ operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication\
    \ across the network.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information\
    \ provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented\
    \ (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and\
    \ must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\
    \n7. Additional Terms.\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the\
    \ terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\
    \ Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated\
    \ as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid\
    \ under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,\
    \ that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program\
    \ remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\
    \nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any\
    \ additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions\
    \ may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify\
    \ the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to\
    \ a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\
    \nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to\
    \ a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)\
    \ supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n     a) Disclaiming warranty\
    \ or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this\
    \ License; or\n\n     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal\
    \ notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\
    \ Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation\
    \ of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such\
    \ material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version;\
    \ or\n\n     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors\
    \ or authors of the material; or\n\n     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark\
    \ law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n     f)\
    \ Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone\
    \ who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions\
    \ of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions\
    \ directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive\
    \ additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning\
    \ of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains\
    \ a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that\
    \ is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains\
    \ a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License,\
    \ you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license\
    \ document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing\
    \ or conveying.\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section,\
    \ you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional\
    \ terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable\
    \ terms.\n\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\
    \ form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements\
    \ apply either way.\n\n8. Termination.\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered\
    \ work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\
    \ to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights\
    \ under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph\
    \ of section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then\
    \ your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\
    \ unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your\
    \ license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of\
    \ the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\
    \nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently\
    \ if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means,\
    \ this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License\
    \ (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior\
    \ to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under\
    \ this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies\
    \ or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and\
    \ not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the\
    \ same material under section 10.\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\
    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy\
    \ of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as\
    \ a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise\
    \ does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants\
    \ you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe\
    \ copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating\
    \ a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n10.\
    \ Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\nEach time you convey a covered\
    \ work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors,\
    \ to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not\
    \ responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n\
    An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization,\
    \ or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging\
    \ organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction,\
    \ each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives\
    \ whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\
    \ give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding\
    \ Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has\
    \ it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further\
    \ restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.\
    \ For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for\
    \ exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\
    \ (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent\
    \ claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing\
    \ the Program or any portion of it.\n\n11. Patents.\nA \"contributor\" is a copyright\
    \ holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which\
    \ the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"\
    contributor version\".\n\nA contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all\
    \ patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired\
    \ or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by\
    \ this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not\
    \ include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification\
    \ of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes\
    \ the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements\
    \ of this License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,\
    \ royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims,\
    \ to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate\
    \ the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs,\
    \ a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated,\
    \ not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent\
    \ or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent\
    \ license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce\
    \ a patent against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying\
    \ on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available\
    \ for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through\
    \ a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then\
    \ you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2)\
    \ arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular\
    \ work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License,\
    \ to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\"\
    \ means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying\
    \ the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in\
    \ a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that\
    \ you have reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with\
    \ a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance\
    \ of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving\
    \ the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific\
    \ copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically\
    \ extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\nA patent\
    \ license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its\
    \ coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of\
    \ one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.\
    \ You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with\
    \ a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which\
    \ you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of\
    \ conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties\
    \ who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license\
    \ (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies\
    \ made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific\
    \ products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into\
    \ that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\
    \nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied\
    \ license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to\
    \ you under applicable patent law.\n\n12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\nIf\
    \ conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)\
    \ that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from\
    \ the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to\
    \ satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\
    \ obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example,\
    \ if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying\
    \ from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both\
    \ those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the\
    \ Program.\n\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\nNotwithstanding\
    \ any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine\
    \ any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General\
    \ Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.\
    \ The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered\
    \ work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\
    \ section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination\
    \ as such.\n\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\nThe Free Software Foundation\
    \ may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from\
    \ time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\
    \ but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version\
    \ is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain\
    \ numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\"\
    \ applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either\
    \ of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General\
    \ Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\
    \ versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public\
    \ statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that\
    \ version for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or\
    \ different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\
    \ author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\
    \n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT\
    \ PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\
    \ HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\
    \ OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\
    \ IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\
    \ THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.\
    \ SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\
    \ REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. Limitation of Liability.\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED\
    \ BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY\
    \ OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE\
    \ TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\
    \ DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT\
    \ NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED\
    \ BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\
    \ PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY\
    \ OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\nIf the disclaimer\
    \ of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local\
    \ legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law\
    \ that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in\
    \ connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies\
    \ a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\
    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program,\
    \ and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way\
    \ to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute\
    \ and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the\
    \ program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\
    \ effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\
    \ the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n\
    \     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n\
    \     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n     This program is free software:\
    \ you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General\
    \ Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version\
    \ 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n     This program\
    \ is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;\
    \ without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\
    \ PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n     You should\
    \ have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.\
    \  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how\
    \ to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal\
    \ interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive\
    \ mode:\n\n     <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n     This program\
    \ comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n     This is\
    \ free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;\
    \ type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c'\
    \ should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course,\
    \ your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use\
    \ an \"about box\".\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)\
    \ or school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\
    \ For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\
    \nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\

    \ of this License. But first, please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>."

  extractedText: "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright\
    \ © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n\nEveryone is permitted\
    \ to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing\
    \ it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free,\
    \ copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for\
    \ most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom\
    \ to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\
    \ intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to\
    \ make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software\
    \ Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it\
    \ applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply\
    \ it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring\
    \ to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure\
    \ that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\
    \ for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want\
    \ it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs,\
    \ and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need\
    \ to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the\
    \ rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies\
    \ of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom\
    \ of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\
    \ gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that\
    \ you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\
    \ code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers\
    \ that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright\
    \ on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission\
    \ to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers' and authors' protection,\
    \ the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For\
    \ both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked\
    \ as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors\
    \ of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install\
    \ or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\
    \ can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users'\
    \ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs\
    \ in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it\
    \ is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to\
    \ prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially\
    \ in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in\
    \ future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally,\
    \ every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not\
    \ allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose\
    \ computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents\
    \ applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent\
    \ this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\
    \nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   0. Definitions.\n\n   \"This License\"\
    \ refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n   \"Copyright\" also\
    \ means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor\
    \ masks.\n\n   \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under\
    \ this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\"\
    \ may be individuals or organizations.\n\n   To \"modify\" a work means to copy\
    \ from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission,\
    \ other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified\
    \ version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n \
    \  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the\
    \ Program.\n\n   To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\
    \ permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under\
    \ applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private\
    \ copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),\
    \ making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\
    \n   To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties\
    \ to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network,\
    \ with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n   An interactive user interface\
    \ displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient\
    \ and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice,\
    \ and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\
    \ extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under\
    \ this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents\
    \ a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the\
    \ list meets this criterion.\n\n   1. Source Code.\n\n   The \"source code\" for\
    \ a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.\
    \ \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work.\n\n   A \"Standard Interface\"\
    \ means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized\
    \ standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming\
    \ language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\
    \n   The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than\
    \ the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a\
    \ Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves\
    \ only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a\
    \ Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in\
    \ source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential\
    \ component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\
    \ (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the\
    \ work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n   The \"Corresponding\
    \ Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to\
    \ generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify\
    \ the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not\
    \ include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available\
    \ free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which\
    \ are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface\
    \ definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code\
    \ for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically\
    \ designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow\
    \ between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n   The Corresponding\
    \ Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from\
    \ other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\n   The Corresponding Source for\
    \ a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n   2. Basic Permissions.\n\n\
    \   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright\
    \ on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.\
    \ This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified\
    \ Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only\
    \ if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges\
    \ your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\
    \n   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without\
    \ conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey\
    \ covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications\
    \ exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,\
    \ provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material\
    \ for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered\
    \ works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and\
    \ control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted\
    \ material outside their relationship with you.\n\n   Conveying under any other\
    \ circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing\
    \ is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n   3. Protecting Users'\
    \ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n   No covered work shall be deemed\
    \ part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling\
    \ obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December\
    \ 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\
    \n   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention\
    \ of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising\
    \ rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim\
    \ any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing,\
    \ against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention\
    \ of technological measures.\n\n   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n   You may\
    \ convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any\
    \ medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy\
    \ an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License\
    \ and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\
    \ keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients\
    \ a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n   You may charge any price\
    \ or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty\
    \ protection for a fee.\n\n   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n   You\
    \ may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from\
    \ the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided\
    \ that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n      a) The work must carry\
    \ prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n\
    \n      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under\
    \ this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies\
    \ the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n      c) You\
    \ must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes\
    \ into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any\
    \ applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its\
    \ parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission\
    \ to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission\
    \ if you have separately received it.\n\n      d) If the work has interactive\
    \ user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the\
    \ Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices,\
    \ your work need not make them do so.\n\n   A compilation of a covered work with\
    \ other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions\
    \ of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger\
    \ program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\
    \ \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to\
    \ limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the\
    \ individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not\
    \ cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n   6. Conveying\
    \ Non-Source Forms.\n\n   You may convey a covered work in object code form under\
    \ the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable\
    \ Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\
    \n      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including\
    \ a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed\
    \ on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n\
    \      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including\
    \ a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at\
    \ least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer\
    \ support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code\
    \ either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product\
    \ that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used\
    \ for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically\
    \ performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding\
    \ Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n      c) Convey individual copies\
    \ of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding\
    \ Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\
    \ only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection\
    \ 6b.\n\n      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\
    \ place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding\
    \ Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need\
    \ not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object\
    \ code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding\
    \ Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that\
    \ supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions\
    \ next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless\
    \ of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure\
    \ that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n\
    \      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you\
    \ inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work\
    \ are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\n\
    \   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from\
    \ the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying\
    \ the object code work.\n\n   A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\"\
    , which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,\
    \ family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\
    \ into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful\
    \ cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received\
    \ by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of\
    \ that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of\
    \ the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected\
    \ to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the\
    \ product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless\
    \ such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n   \"\
    Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization\
    \ keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions\
    \ of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding\
    \ Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning\
    \ of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely\
    \ because modification has been made.\n\n   If you convey an object code work\
    \ under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product,\
    \ and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession\
    \ and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or\
    \ for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding\
    \ Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.\
    \ But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains\
    \ the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example,\
    \ the work has been installed in ROM).\n\n   The requirement to provide Installation\
    \ Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service,\
    \ warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient,\
    \ or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to\
    \ a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely\
    \ affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for\
    \ communication across the network.\n\n   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation\
    \ Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is\
    \ publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source\
    \ code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading\
    \ or copying.\n\n   7. Additional Terms.\n\n   \"Additional permissions\" are\
    \ terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one\
    \ or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the\
    \ entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License,\
    \ to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions\
    \ apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those\
    \ permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without\
    \ regard to the additional permissions.\n\n   When you convey a copy of a covered\
    \ work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy,\
    \ or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their\
    \ own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional\
    \ permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have\
    \ or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n   Notwithstanding any other\
    \ provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if\
    \ authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of\
    \ this License with terms:\n\n      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability\
    \ differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n   \
    \   b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author\
    \ attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed\
    \ by works containing it; or\n\n      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the\
    \ origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material\
    \ be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n\
    \      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors\
    \ of the material; or\n\n      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law\
    \ for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n      f) Requiring\
    \ indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys\
    \ the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability\
    \ to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly\
    \ impose on those licensors and authors.\n\n   All other non-permissive additional\
    \ terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section\
    \ 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice\
    \ stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further\
    \ restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further\
    \ restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may\
    \ add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document,\
    \ provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\
    \n   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must\
    \ place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that\
    \ apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n\
    \n   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form\
    \ of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements\
    \ apply either way.\n\n   8. Termination.\n\n   You may not propagate or modify\
    \ a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt\
    \ otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate\
    \ your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under\
    \ the third paragraph of section 11).\n\n   However, if you cease all violation\
    \ of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated\
    \ (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally\
    \ terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails\
    \ to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after\
    \ the cessation.\n\n   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder\
    \ is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation\
    \ by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of\
    \ violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you\
    \ cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\n  \
    \ Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses\
    \ of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If\
    \ your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not\
    \ qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n\
    \   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n   You are not required to\
    \ accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary\
    \ propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer\
    \ transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\
    \ nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify\
    \ any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this\
    \ License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate\
    \ your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream\
    \ Recipients.\n\n   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\
    \ receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate\
    \ that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance\
    \ by third parties with this License.\n\n   An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction\
    \ transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one,\
    \ or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of\
    \ a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction\
    \ who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work\
    \ the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph,\
    \ plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the\
    \ predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable\
    \ efforts.\n\n   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of\
    \ the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not\
    \ impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted\
    \ under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim\
    \ or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by\
    \ making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion\
    \ of it.\n\n   11. Patents.\n\n   A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who\
    \ authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program\
    \ is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\"\
    .\n\n   A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned\
    \ or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,\
    \ that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,\
    \ using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would\
    \ be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor\
    \ version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to\
    \ grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this\
    \ License.\n\n   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\
    \ patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use,\
    \ sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents\
    \ of its contributor version.\n\n   In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent\
    \ license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to\
    \ enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant\
    \ not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\
    \ party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent\
    \ against the party.\n\n   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on\
    \ a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available\
    \ for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through\
    \ a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then\
    \ you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2)\
    \ arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular\
    \ work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License,\
    \ to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\"\
    \ means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying\
    \ the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in\
    \ a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that\
    \ you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n   If, pursuant to or in connection\
    \ with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring\
    \ conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\
    \ receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey\
    \ a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically\
    \ extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\n  \
    \ A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope\
    \ of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise\
    \ of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.\
    \ You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with\
    \ a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which\
    \ you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of\
    \ conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties\
    \ who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license\
    \ (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies\
    \ made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific\
    \ products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into\
    \ that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\
    \n   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied\
    \ license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to\
    \ you under applicable patent law.\n\n   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\
    \n   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)\
    \ that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from\
    \ the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to\
    \ satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\
    \ obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example,\
    \ if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying\
    \ from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both\
    \ those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the\
    \ Program.\n\n   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n   Notwithstanding\
    \ any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine\
    \ any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General\
    \ Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.\
    \ The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered\
    \ work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\
    \ section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination\
    \ as such.\n\n   14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n   The Free Software\
    \ Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public\
    \ License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the\
    \ present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\
    \n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies\
    \ that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later\
    \ version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions\
    \ either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free\
    \ Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the\
    \ GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the\
    \ Free Software Foundation.\n\n   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide\
    \ which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\
    \ public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose\
    \ that version for the Program.\n\n   Later license versions may give you additional\
    \ or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on\
    \ any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later\
    \ version.\n\n   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE\
    \ PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED\
    \ IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"\
    AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   16. Limitation of Liability.\n\
    \n   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\
    \ ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM\
    \ AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,\
    \ INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE\
    \ THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\
    \ INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM\
    \ TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS\
    \ BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n   17. Interpretation of\
    \ Sections 15 and 16.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability\
    \ provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\
    \ reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute\
    \ waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty\
    \ or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a\
    \ fee.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New\
    \ Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\
    \ possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free\
    \ software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo\
    \ do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them\
    \ to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of\
    \ warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer\
    \ to where the full notice is found.\n\n<one line to give the program's name and\
    \ a brief idea of what it does.>\n\nCopyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n\n\
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\
    \ the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\
    \nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\
    \ ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS\
    \ FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\
    \nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with\
    \ this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information\
    \ on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal\
    \ interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive\
    \ mode:\n\n<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n\nThis program comes\
    \ with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n\nThis is free software,\
    \ and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show\
    \ c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show\
    \ the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's\
    \ commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\"\
    .\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\
    \ if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. For\
    \ more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\
    \nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\
    \ proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider\
    \ it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.\

    \ of this License. But first, please read <https://www.gnu.org/ licenses /why-not-lgpl.html>."

  extractedText: "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright\
    \ © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n\nEveryone is permitted\
    \ to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing\
    \ it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free,\
    \ copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for\
    \ most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom\
    \ to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\
    \ intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to\
    \ make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software\
    \ Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it\
    \ applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply\
    \ it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring\
    \ to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure\
    \ that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\
    \ for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want\
    \ it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs,\
    \ and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need\
    \ to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the\
    \ rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies\
    \ of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom\
    \ of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\
    \ gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that\
    \ you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\
    \ code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers\
    \ that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright\
    \ on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission\
    \ to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers' and authors' protection,\
    \ the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For\
    \ both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked\
    \ as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors\
    \ of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install\
    \ or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\
    \ can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users'\
    \ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs\
    \ in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it\
    \ is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to\
    \ prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially\
    \ in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in\
    \ future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally,\
    \ every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not\
    \ allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose\
    \ computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents\
    \ applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent\
    \ this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\
    \nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n0. Definitions.\n\n\"This License\" refers\
    \ to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n\"Copyright\" also means\
    \ copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor\
    \ masks.\n\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\
    \ License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\"\
    \ may be individuals or organizations.\n\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from\
    \ or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission,\
    \ other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified\
    \ version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\nA\
    \ \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the\
    \ Program.\n\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\
    \ permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under\
    \ applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private\
    \ copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),\
    \ making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\
    \nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties\
    \ to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network,\
    \ with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface\
    \ displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient\
    \ and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice,\
    \ and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\
    \ extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under\
    \ this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents\
    \ a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the\
    \ list meets this criterion.\n\n1. Source Code.\n\nThe \"source code\" for a work\
    \ means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \"Object\
    \ code\" means any non-source form of a work.\n\nA \"Standard Interface\" means\
    \ an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards\
    \ body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language,\
    \ one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\nThe \"\
    System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work\
    \ as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component,\
    \ but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable\
    \ use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface\
    \ for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.\
    \ A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel,\
    \ window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which\
    \ the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object\
    \ code interpreter used to run it.\n\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work\
    \ in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and\
    \ (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including\
    \ scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's\
    \ System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs\
    \ which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part\
    \ of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition\
    \ files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared\
    \ libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed\
    \ to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\
    \ subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not\
    \ include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of\
    \ the Corresponding Source.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code\
    \ form is that same work.\n\n2. Basic Permissions.\n\nAll rights granted under\
    \ this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable\
    \ provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your\
    \ unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running\
    \ a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content,\
    \ constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use\
    \ or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\nYou may make, run and\
    \ propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as\
    \ your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others\
    \ for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you,\
    \ or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply\
    \ with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not\
    \ control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must\
    \ do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms\
    \ that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside\
    \ their relationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted\
    \ solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section\
    \ 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention\
    \ Law.\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure\
    \ under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO\
    \ copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or\
    \ restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work,\
    \ you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures\
    \ to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this\
    \ License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to\
    \ limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against\
    \ the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention\
    \ of technological measures.\n\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\nYou may convey\
    \ verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,\
    \ provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\
    \ copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\
    \ non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep\
    \ intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a\
    \ copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge any price or\
    \ no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty\
    \ protection for a fee.\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\nYou may convey\
    \ a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program,\
    \ in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also\
    \ meet all of these conditions:\n\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating\
    \ that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n\nb) The work must carry\
    \ prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions\
    \ added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section\
    \ 4 to \"keep intact all notices\".\n\nc) You must license the entire work, as\
    \ a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This\
    \ License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional\
    \ terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are\
    \ packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other\
    \ way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received\
    \ it.\n\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate\
    \ Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not\
    \ display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n\nA\
    \ compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which\
    \ are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined\
    \ with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or\
    \ distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting\
    \ copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's\
    \ users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in\
    \ an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the\
    \ aggregate.\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\nYou may convey a covered work\
    \ in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also\
    \ convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\
    \ in one of these ways:\n\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical\
    \ product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding\
    \ Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\
    \nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including\
    \ a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at\
    \ least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer\
    \ support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code\
    \ either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product\
    \ that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used\
    \ for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically\
    \ performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding\
    \ Source from a network server at no charge.\n\nc) Convey individual copies of\
    \ the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding\
    \ Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\
    \ only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection\
    \ 6b.\n\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place\
    \ (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source\
    \ in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require\
    \ recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the\
    \ place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\
    \ may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports\
    \ equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to\
    \ the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of\
    \ what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that\
    \ it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\ne) Convey\
    \ the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers\
    \ where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered\
    \ to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion\
    \ of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source\
    \ as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n\
    \nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible\
    \ personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household\
    \ purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.\
    \ In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall\
    \ be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular\
    \ user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product,\
    \ regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular\
    \ user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product\
    \ is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,\
    \ industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant\
    \ mode of use of the product.\n\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product\
    \ means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required\
    \ to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product\
    \ from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice\
    \ to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no\
    \ case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n\
    \nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically\
    \ for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction\
    \ in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred\
    \ to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction\
    \ is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must\
    \ be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not\
    \ apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified\
    \ object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in\
    \ ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include\
    \ a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for\
    \ a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User\
    \ Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may\
    \ be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the\
    \ operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication\
    \ across the network.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information\
    \ provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented\
    \ (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and\
    \ must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\
    \n7. Additional Terms.\n\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement\
    \ the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\
    \ Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated\
    \ as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid\
    \ under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,\
    \ that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program\
    \ remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\
    \nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any\
    \ additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions\
    \ may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify\
    \ the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to\
    \ a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\
    \nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to\
    \ a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)\
    \ supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\na) Disclaiming warranty\
    \ or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this\
    \ License; or\n\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices\
    \ or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices\
    \ displayed by works containing it; or\n\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of\
    \ the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material\
    \ be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n\
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of\
    \ the material; or\n\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use\
    \ of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\nf) Requiring indemnification\
    \ of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material\
    \ (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the\
    \ recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose\
    \ on those licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms\
    \ are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If\
    \ the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating\
    \ that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,\
    \ you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction\
    \ but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered\
    \ work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that\
    \ the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n\
    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place,\
    \ in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply\
    \ to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n\
    \nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of\
    \ a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements\
    \ apply either way.\n\n8. Termination.\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered\
    \ work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\
    \ to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights\
    \ under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph\
    \ of section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then\
    \ your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\
    \ unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your\
    \ license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of\
    \ the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\
    \nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently\
    \ if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means,\
    \ this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License\
    \ (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior\
    \ to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under\
    \ this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies\
    \ or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and\
    \ not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the\
    \ same material under section 10.\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\
    \nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy\
    \ of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as\
    \ a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise\
    \ does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants\
    \ you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe\
    \ copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating\
    \ a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n10.\
    \ Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\nEach time you convey a covered\
    \ work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors,\
    \ to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not\
    \ responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n\
    An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization,\
    \ or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging\
    \ organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction,\
    \ each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives\
    \ whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\
    \ give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding\
    \ Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has\
    \ it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further\
    \ restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.\
    \ For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for\
    \ exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\
    \ (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent\
    \ claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing\
    \ the Program or any portion of it.\n\n11. Patents.\n\nA \"contributor\" is a\
    \ copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work\
    \ on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's\
    \ \"contributor version\".\n\nA contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are\
    \ all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired\
    \ or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by\
    \ this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not\
    \ include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification\
    \ of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes\
    \ the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements\
    \ of this License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,\
    \ royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims,\
    \ to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate\
    \ the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs,\
    \ a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated,\
    \ not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent\
    \ or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent\
    \ license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce\
    \ a patent against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying\
    \ on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available\
    \ for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through\
    \ a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then\
    \ you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2)\
    \ arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular\
    \ work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License,\
    \ to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\"\
    \ means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying\
    \ the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in\
    \ a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that\
    \ you have reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with\
    \ a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance\
    \ of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving\
    \ the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific\
    \ copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically\
    \ extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\nA patent\
    \ license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its\
    \ coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of\
    \ one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.\
    \ You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with\
    \ a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which\
    \ you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of\
    \ conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties\
    \ who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license\
    \ (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies\
    \ made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific\
    \ products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into\
    \ that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\
    \nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied\
    \ license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to\
    \ you under applicable patent law.\n\n12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n\
    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)\
    \ that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from\
    \ the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to\
    \ satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\
    \ obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example,\
    \ if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying\
    \ from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both\
    \ those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the\
    \ Program.\n\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\nNotwithstanding\
    \ any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine\
    \ any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General\
    \ Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.\
    \ The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered\
    \ work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\
    \ section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination\
    \ as such.\n\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation\
    \ may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from\
    \ time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\
    \ but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version\
    \ is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain\
    \ numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\"\
    \ applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either\
    \ of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General\
    \ Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\
    \ versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public\
    \ statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that\
    \ version for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or\
    \ different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\
    \ author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\
    \n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE\
    \ EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING\
    \ THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT\
    \ WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED\
    \ TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\
    \ THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.\
    \ SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\
    \ REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. Limitation of Liability.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE,\
    \ BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\
    \ CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE\
    \ WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\
    \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and\
    \ 16.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above\
    \ cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts\
    \ shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all\
    \ civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption\
    \ of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\nEND OF\
    \ TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf\
    \ you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use\
    \ to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which\
    \ everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach\
    \ the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start\
    \ of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and\
    \ each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where\
    \ the full notice is found.\n\n<one line to give the program's name and a brief\
    \ idea of what it does.>\n\nCopyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n\nThis program\
    \ is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of\
    \ the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,\
    \ either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n\
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY\
    \ WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\
    \nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with\
    \ this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information\
    \ on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal\
    \ interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive\
    \ mode:\n\n<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n\nThis program comes\
    \ with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n\nThis is free software,\
    \ and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show\
    \ c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show\
    \ the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's\
    \ commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\"\
    .\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\
    \ if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. For\
    \ more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\
    \nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\
    \ proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider\
    \ it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.\
    \ If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead\
    \ of this License. But first, please read <https://www.gnu.org/ licenses /why-not-lgpl.html>.\n\
    \n\nAs a special exception, the respective Autoconf Macro's copyright owner\n\

    \ the terms of the GNU General Public License when using\nor distributing such\
    \ scripts, even though portions of the text of the\nMacro appear in them. The\

    \ (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\n51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston,\
    \ MA 02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim\
    \ copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n[This is\
    \ the first released version of the library GPL. It is numbered 2 because it goes\
    \ with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software\
    \ are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast,\
    \ the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share\
    \ and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\
    \nThis license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially\
    \ designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose\
    \ authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.\n\nWhen we\
    \ speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General\
    \ Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute\
    \ copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you\
    \ receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software\
    \ or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these\
    \ things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\
    \ anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\
    \ restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute\
    \ copies of the library, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute\
    \ copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients\
    \ all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive\
    \ or can get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must\
    \ provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\
    \ with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And\
    \ you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nOur method of protecting\
    \ your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this\
    \ license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the\
    \ library.\n\nAlso, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\
    \ that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If\
    \ the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients\
    \ to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems\
    \ introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\
    \nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish\
    \ to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually\
    \ obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary\
    \ software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed\
    \ for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nMost GNU software, including\
    \ some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which\
    \ was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public\
    \ License, applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different\
    \ from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything\
    \ in it is the same as in the ordinary license.\n\nThe reason we have a separate\
    \ public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually\
    \ make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a\
    \ program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply\
    \ using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application\
    \ program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined\
    \ work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public\
    \ License treats it as such.\n\nBecause of this blurred distinction, using the\
    \ ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\
    \ sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that\
    \ weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n\nHowever, unrestricted linking\
    \ of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit\
    \ from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public\
    \ License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries,\
    \ while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\
    \ libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this\
    \ as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes\
    \ in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to\
    \ faster development of free libraries.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for\
    \ copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference\
    \ between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\"\
    . The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works\
    \ together with the library.\n\nNote that it is possible for a library to be covered\
    \ by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one.\n\n\
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n   0. This\
    \ License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed\
    \ by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed\
    \ under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called \"this License\"\
    ). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n   A \"library\" means a collection\
    \ of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with\
    \ application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\
    \n   The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which\
    \ has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means\
    \ either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say,\
    \ a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications\
    \ and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation\
    \ is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n   \"Source\
    \ code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications\
    \ to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all\
    \ modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the\
    \ scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\n\n   Activities\
    \ other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License;\
    \ they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is\
    \ not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents\
    \ constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library\
    \ in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library\
    \ does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n   1. You may copy\
    \ and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you\
    \ receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\
    \ publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;\
    \ keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of\
    \ any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\n\
    \n   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you\
    \ may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n   2.\
    \ You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus\
    \ forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications\
    \ or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all\
    \ of these conditions:\n\n      a) The modified work must itself be a software\
    \ library.\n\n      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\
    \ stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n      c) You\
    \ must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties\
    \ under the terms of this License.\n\n      d) If a facility in the modified Library\
    \ refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program\
    \ that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is\
    \ invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event\
    \ an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates,\
    \ and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n      (For\
    \ example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that\
    \ is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection\
    \ 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function\
    \ must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function\
    \ must still compute square roots.)\n\n   These requirements apply to the modified\
    \ work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from\
    \ the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works\
    \ in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections\
    \ when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same\
    \ sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution\
    \ of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other\
    \ licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless\
    \ of who wrote it.\n\n   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights\
    \ or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is\
    \ to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective\
    \ works based on the Library.\n\n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work\
    \ not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library)\
    \ on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work\
    \ under the scope of this License.\n\n   3. You may opt to apply the terms of\
    \ the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy\
    \ of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this\
    \ License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version\
    \ 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary\
    \ GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead\
    \ if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\n\n   Once this\
    \ change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary\
    \ GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works\
    \ made from that copy.\n\n   This option is useful when you wish to copy part\
    \ of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n   4. You\
    \ may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under\
    \ Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\
    \ 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\
    \ source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\
    \ on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n   If distribution\
    \ of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then\
    \ offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies\
    \ the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are\
    \ not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n   5. A program\
    \ that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to\
    \ work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work\
    \ that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work\
    \ of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n \
    \  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates\
    \ an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions\
    \ of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable\
    \ is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution\
    \ of such executables.\n\n   When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material\
    \ from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work\
    \ may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\
    \ Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without\
    \ the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be\
    \ true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n   If such an object file uses only\
    \ numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros\
    \ and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the\
    \ object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\
    \ work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library\
    \ will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative\
    \ of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms\
    \ of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\
    \ whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n   6. As\
    \ an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a \"work that\
    \ uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of\
    \ the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that\
    \ the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\
    \ engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n   You must give prominent\
    \ notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the\
    \ Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this\
    \ License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include\
    \ the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing\
    \ the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\n\
    \n      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable\
    \ source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work\
    \ (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is\
    \ an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"\
    work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user\
    \ can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing\
    \ the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents\
    \ of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile\
    \ the application to use the modified definitions.)\n\n      b) Accompany the\
    \ work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same\
    \ user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than\
    \ the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n      c) If distribution of the\
    \ work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent\
    \ access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\n\n      d)\
    \ Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that\
    \ you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n   For an executable, the required\
    \ form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility\
    \ programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special\
    \ exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\
    \ distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,\
    \ kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless\
    \ that component itself accompanies the executable.\n\n   It may happen that this\
    \ requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries\
    \ that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means\
    \ you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\
    \ distribute.\n\n   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based\
    \ on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\
    \ facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library,\
    \ provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and\
    \ of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you\
    \ do these two things:\n\n      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy\
    \ of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.\
    \ This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\n\n      b)\
    \ Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it\
    \ is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying\
    \ uncombined form of the same work.\n\n   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense,\
    \ link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this\
    \ License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\
    \ the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this\
    \ License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\
    \ this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties\
    \ remain in full compliance.\n\n   9. You are not required to accept this License,\
    \ since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to\
    \ modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are\
    \ prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying\
    \ or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate\
    \ your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for\
    \ copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\n\n   10.\
    \ Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the\
    \ recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,\
    \ distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions.\
    \ You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\
    \ rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third\
    \ parties to this License.\n\n   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment\
    \ or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to\
    \ patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement\
    \ or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse\
    \ you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\
    \ simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,\
    \ then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example,\
    \ if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library\
    \ by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the\
    \ only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely\
    \ from distribution of the Library.\n\n   If any portion of this section is held\
    \ invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the\
    \ section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply\
    \ in other circumstances.\n\n   It is not the purpose of this section to induce\
    \ you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity\
    \ of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity\
    \ of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license\
    \ practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of\
    \ software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application\
    \ of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\
    \ to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose\
    \ that choice.\n\n   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is\
    \ believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n   12. If the distribution\
    \ and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents\
    \ or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library\
    \ under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation\
    \ excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\
    \ countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation\
    \ as if written in the body of this License.\n\n   13. The Free Software Foundation\
    \ may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library General Public License\
    \ from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present\
    \ version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n \
    \  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies\
    \ a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library\
    \ does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published\
    \ by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   14. If you wish to incorporate parts\
    \ of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible\
    \ with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is\
    \ copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n   NO WARRANTY\n\
    \n   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\
    \ FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE\
    \ WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\
    \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply\
    \ These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\nIf you develop a new library, and you want\
    \ it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it\
    \ free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting\
    \ redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\
    \ ordinary General Public License).\n\nTo apply these terms, attach the following\
    \ notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source\
    \ file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\
    \ have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice\
    \ is found.\n\none line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.\n\
    \nCopyright (C) year name of author\n\nThis library is free software; you can\
    \ redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General\
    \ Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version\
    \ 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis library is\
    \ distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without\
    \ even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\

    \ 2.1, February 1999\n\n Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\
    \ 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n Everyone is permitted\
    \ to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing\
    \ it is not allowed.\n\n[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.\
    \  It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version\
    \ 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\
    \n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to\
    \ share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended\
    \ to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the\
    \ software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public\
    \ License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically\
    \ libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to\
    \ use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about\
    \ whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\n\
    strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n \
    \ When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.\
    \  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom\
    \ to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish);\
    \ that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change\
    \ the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed\
    \ that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make\
    \ restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you\
    \ to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities\
    \ for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For\
    \ example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee,\
    \ you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make\
    \ sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other\
    \ code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients,\
    \ so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library\
    \ and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\
    \ rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright\
    \ the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission\
    \ to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor,\
    \ we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.\
    \  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients\
    \ should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\n\
    author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced\
    \ by others.\n\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence\
    \ of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively\
    \ restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from\
    \ a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for\
    \ a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified\
    \ in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered\
    \ by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\n\
    General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite\
    \ different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for\
    \ certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free\
    \ programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or\
    \ using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\n\
    combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public\
    \ License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits\
    \ its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax\
    \ criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license\
    \ the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's\
    \ freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free\
    \ software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.\
    \  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License\
    \ for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\n\
    special circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special\
    \ need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\
    \ becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\n\
    allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does\
    \ the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little\
    \ to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser\
    \ General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular\
    \ library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large\
    \ body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\n\
    non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system,\
    \ as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser\
    \ General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure\
    \ that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom\
    \ and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\
    \n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification\
    \ follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the\
    \ library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived\
    \ from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order\
    \ to run.\n\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND\
    \ CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement\
    \ applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed\
    \ by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed\
    \ under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"\
    ).\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection\
    \ of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked\
    \ with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form\
    \ executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library\
    \ or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\n\
    Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law:\
    \ that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim\
    \ or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.\
    \  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\"\
    .)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n\
    making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the\
    \ source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition\
    \ files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the\
    \ library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are\
    \ not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning\
    \ a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program\
    \ is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent\
    \ of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true\
    \ depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library\
    \ does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\n\
    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously\
    \ and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and\
    \ disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License\
    \ and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along\
    \ with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring\
    \ a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for\
    \ a\nfee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\n\
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such\
    \ modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you\
    \ also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be\
    \ a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent\
    \ notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\
    \n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge\
    \ to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility\
    \ in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied\
    \ by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument\
    \ passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort\
    \ to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function\
    \ or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n\
    \    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library\
    \ to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent\
    \ of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied\
    \ function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application\
    \ does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square\
    \ roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable\
    \ sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably\
    \ considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License,\
    \ and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate\
    \ works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which\
    \ is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the\
    \ terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n\
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\n\
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights\
    \ to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right\
    \ to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the\
    \ Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\n\
    with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage\
    \ or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this\
    \ License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General\
    \ Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To\
    \ do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat\
    \ they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of\
    \ to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General\
    \ Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you\
    \ wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\n  Once this change\
    \ is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary\
    \ GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative\
    \ works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy\
    \ part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n \
    \ 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it,\
    \ under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections\
    \ 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding\
    \ machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of\
    \ Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\
    \n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a\
    \ designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from\
    \ the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even\
    \ though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object\
    \ code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\n\
    Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked\
    \ with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation,\
    \ is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope\
    \ of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with\
    \ the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because\
    \ it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\n\
    library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states\
    \ terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the\
    \ Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the\
    \ object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though\
    \ the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the\
    \ work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.\
    \  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If\
    \ such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts\
    \ and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less\
    \ in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of\
    \ whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object\
    \ code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise,\
    \ if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code\
    \ for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that\
    \ work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with\
    \ the Library itself.\n\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also\
    \ combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce\
    \ a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder\
    \ terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work\
    \ for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\
    \n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary\
    \ is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.\
    \  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays\
    \ copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among\
    \ them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.\
    \  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the\
    \ complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including\
    \ whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n\
    \    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with\
    \ the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\"\
    , as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library\
    \ and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified\
    \ Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions\
    \ files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n\
    \    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library\
    \ mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that\
    \ (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's\
    \ computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable,\
    \ and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n\
    \    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible\
    \ with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with\
    \ a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user\
    \ the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n\
    \    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution\
    \ of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place,\
    \ offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the\
    \ same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n\
    \    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable,\
    \ the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data\
    \ and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However,\
    \ as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything\
    \ that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n\
    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the\
    \ executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\
    \n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions\
    \ of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating\
    \ system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library\
    \ together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\n  7. You may place library\
    \ facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library\
    \ together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute\
    \ such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work\
    \ based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted,\
    \ and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined\
    \ library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with\
    \ any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms\
    \ of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined\
    \ library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and\
    \ explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\
    \n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library\
    \ except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to\
    \ copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and\
    \ will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties\
    \ who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have\
    \ their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\
    \n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned\
    \ it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the\
    \ Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you\
    \ do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library\
    \ (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License\
    \ to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n\
    the Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library\
    \ (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a\
    \ license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify\
    \ the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any\
    \ further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\
    \n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement\
    \ or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed\
    \ on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the\
    \ conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this\
    \ License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations\
    \ under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence\
    \ you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense\
    \ would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who\
    \ receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could\
    \ satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution\
    \ of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable\
    \ under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\
    \ apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\
    \nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents\
    \ or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this\
    \ section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software\
    \ distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many\
    \ people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n\
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it\
    \ is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software\
    \ through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis\
    \ section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence\
    \ of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the\
    \ Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted\
    \ interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this\
    \ License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\
    \ those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries\
    \ not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation\
    \ as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation\
    \ may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License\
    \ from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present\
    \ version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n\
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies\
    \ a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the\
    \ Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version\
    \ ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\n  14. If you wish to incorporate\
    \ parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions\
    \ are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For\
    \ software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the\
    \ Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision\
    \ will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives\
    \ of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\
    \n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED\
    \ FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED\
    \ BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS\
    \ AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\n\
    KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED\
    \ WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE\
    \ RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD\
    \ THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\
    \ REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW\
    \ OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY\
    \ MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\n\
    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\
    \ ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\
    \ TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU\
    \ OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE),\
    \ EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n\
    DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n           How\
    \ to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library,\
    \ and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend\
    \ making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can\
    \ do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under\
    \ the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms,\
    \ attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to\
    \ the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty;\
    \ and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to\
    \ where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the library's name\

    \nCopyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street,\
    \ Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute\
    \ verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\
    \n[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts\nas the\
    \ successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\nthe version number\
    \ 2.1.]\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away\
    \ your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses\
    \ are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\
    \ make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\nThis license, the Lesser\
    \ General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically\
    \ libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use\
    \ it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\
    \ this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to\
    \ use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\nWhen we speak\
    \ of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General\
    \ Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute\
    \ copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you\
    \ receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software\
    \ and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you\
    \ can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions\
    \ that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender\
    \ these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you\
    \ if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\nFor example,\
    \ if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must\
    \ give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that\
    \ they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the\
    \ library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they\
    \ can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\
    \ it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect\
    \ your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we\
    \ offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\
    \ and/or modify the library.\n\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it\
    \ very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library\
    \ is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what\
    \ they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation\
    \ will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\n\nFinally,\
    \ software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program.\
    \ We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of\
    \ a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore,\
    \ we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must\
    \ be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\nMost\
    \ GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General\
    \ Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies\
    \ to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General\
    \ Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit\
    \ linking those libraries into non-free programs.\n\nWhen a program is linked\
    \ with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination\
    \ of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original\
    \ library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking\
    \ only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General\
    \ Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.\n\
    \nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less\
    \ to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also\
    \ provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing\
    \ non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General\
    \ Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages\
    \ in certain special circumstances.\n\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may\
    \ be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library,\
    \ so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must\
    \ be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does\
    \ the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little\
    \ to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser\
    \ General Public License.\n\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library\
    \ in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body\
    \ of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free\
    \ programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as\
    \ well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\n\nAlthough the Lesser\
    \ General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure\
    \ that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and\
    \ the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.\n\
    \nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the\
    \ library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived\
    \ from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order\
    \ to run.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\
    \n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which\
    \ contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying\
    \ it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License\
    \ (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nA\
    \ \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so\
    \ as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those\
    \ functions and data) to form executables.\n\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to\
    \ any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms.\
    \ A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work\
    \ under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion\
    \ of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly\
    \ into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation\
    \ in the term \"modification\".)\n\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred\
    \ form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source\
    \ code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\
    \ interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and\
    \ installation of the library.\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution\
    \ and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.\
    \ The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output\
    \ from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\
    \ on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing\
    \ it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program\
    \ that uses the Library does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies\
    \ of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided\
    \ that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\
    \ copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that\
    \ refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy\
    \ of this License along with the Library.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical\
    \ act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection\
    \ in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library\
    \ or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\
    \ distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided\
    \ that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) The modified work must itself\
    \ be a software library.\nb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent\
    \ notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\nc) You\
    \ must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties\
    \ under the terms of this License.\nd) If a facility in the modified Library refers\
    \ to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that\
    \ uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked,\
    \ then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application\
    \ does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs\
    \ whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n(For example, a function in\
    \ a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined\
    \ independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied\
    \ function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application\
    \ does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\n\
    \nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections\
    \ of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered\
    \ independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,\
    \ do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But\
    \ when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\
    \ on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,\
    \ whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to\
    \ each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent\
    \ of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely\
    \ by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution\
    \ of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere\
    \ aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with\
    \ a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium\
    \ does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n\n3. You may\
    \ opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of\
    \ this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all\
    \ the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU\
    \ General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version\
    \ than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then\
    \ you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change\
    \ in these notices.\n\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible\
    \ for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent\
    \ copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\nThis option is useful when\
    \ you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not\
    \ a library.\n\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative\
    \ of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\
    \ Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding\
    \ machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\
    \ 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\nIf distribution\
    \ of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then\
    \ offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies\
    \ the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are\
    \ not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n5. A program\
    \ that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to\
    \ work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work\
    \ that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work\
    \ of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\nHowever,\
    \ linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable\
    \ that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library),\
    \ rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered\
    \ by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\
    \nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that\
    \ is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work\
    \ of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially\
    \ significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is\
    \ itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined\
    \ by law.\n\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure\
    \ layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines\
    \ or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless\
    \ of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object\
    \ code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n\nOtherwise,\
    \ if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code\
    \ for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work\
    \ also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the\
    \ Library itself.\n\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine\
    \ or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work\
    \ containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of\
    \ your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the\
    \ customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\
    \nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is\
    \ used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You\
    \ must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright\
    \ notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as\
    \ well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you\
    \ must do one of these things:\n\na) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\
    \ machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were\
    \ used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and,\
    \ if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable\
    \ \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\
    \ user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable\
    \ containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes\
    \ the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able\
    \ to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\nb) Use a suitable\
    \ shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism\
    \ is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the\
    \ user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable,\
    \ and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the\
    \ user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with\
    \ the version that the work was made with.\nc) Accompany the work with a written\
    \ offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified\
    \ in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this\
    \ distribution.\nd) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to\
    \ copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified\
    \ materials from the same place.\ne) Verify that the user has already received\
    \ a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\
    For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must\
    \ include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable\
    \ from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need\
    \ not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\
    \ form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating\
    \ system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\
    \ the executable.\n\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\
    \ restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the\
    \ operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the\
    \ Library together in an executable that you distribute.\n\n7. You may place library\
    \ facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library\
    \ together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute\
    \ such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work\
    \ based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted,\
    \ and provided that you do these two things:\n\na) Accompany the combined library\
    \ with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other\
    \ library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections\
    \ above.\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that\
    \ part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\
    \ accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n8. You may not copy, modify,\
    \ sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided\
    \ under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link\
    \ with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\
    \ rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,\
    \ from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long\
    \ as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n9. You are not required to accept\
    \ this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you\
    \ permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These\
    \ actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore,\
    \ by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library),\
    \ you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and\
    \ conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based\
    \ on it.\n\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\
    \ Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor\
    \ to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms\
    \ and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\
    \ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\
    \ compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n11. If, as a consequence of\
    \ a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason\
    \ (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
    \ order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
    \ they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\
    \ so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\
    \ other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\
    \ Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\
    \ redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly\
    \ through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\
    \ be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of\
    \ this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,\
    \ the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole\
    \ is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this\
    \ section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims\
    \ or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose\
    \ of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is\
    \ implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions\
    \ to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on\
    \ consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide\
    \ if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and\
    \ a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly\
    \ clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n\
    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries\
    \ either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder\
    \ who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution\
    \ limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only\
    \ in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\
    \ the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n13. The Free Software\
    \ Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public\
    \ License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the\
    \ present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\
    \nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies\
    \ a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library\
    \ does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published\
    \ by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of\
    \ the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible\
    \ with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is\
    \ copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\
    \n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\
    \ THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE\
    \ WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\
    \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to\
    \ Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\nIf you develop a new library, and\
    \ you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making\
    \ it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by\
    \ permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\
    \ of the ordinary General Public License).\n\nTo apply these terms, attach the\
    \ following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of\
    \ each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each\
    \ file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the\
    \ full notice is found.\n\none line to give the library's name and an idea of\
    \ what it does.\nCopyright (C) year name of author\n\nThis library is free software;\
    \ you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser\

    \nCopyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street,\

    \n[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts\nas the\
    \ successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\nthe version number\
    \ 2.1.]\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away\
    \ your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses\
    \ are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\
    \ make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\nThis license, the Lesser\
    \ General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically\
    \ libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use\
    \ it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\
    \ this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to\
    \ use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\nWhen we speak\
    \ of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General\
    \ Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute\
    \ copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you\
    \ receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software\
    \ and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you\
    \ can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions\
    \ that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender\
    \ these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you\
    \ if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\nFor example,\
    \ if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must\
    \ give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that\
    \ they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the\
    \ library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they\
    \ can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\
    \ it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect\
    \ your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we\
    \ offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\
    \ and/or modify the library.\n\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it\
    \ very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library\
    \ is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what\
    \ they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation\
    \ will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\n\nFinally,\
    \ software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program.\
    \ We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of\
    \ a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore,\
    \ we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must\
    \ be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\nMost\
    \ GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General\
    \ Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies\
    \ to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General\
    \ Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit\
    \ linking those libraries into non-free programs.\n\nWhen a program is linked\
    \ with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination\
    \ of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original\
    \ library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking\
    \ only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General\
    \ Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.\n\
    \nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less\
    \ to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also\
    \ provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing\
    \ non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General\
    \ Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages\
    \ in certain special circumstances.\n\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may\
    \ be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library,\
    \ so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must\
    \ be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does\
    \ the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little\
    \ to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser\
    \ General Public License.\n\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library\
    \ in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body\
    \ of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free\
    \ programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as\
    \ well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\n\nAlthough the Lesser\
    \ General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure\
    \ that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and\
    \ the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.\n\
    \nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the\
    \ library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived\
    \ from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order\
    \ to run.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\
    \n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which\
    \ contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying\
    \ it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License\
    \ (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nA\
    \ \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so\
    \ as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those\
    \ functions and data) to form executables.\n\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to\
    \ any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms.\
    \ A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work\
    \ under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion\
    \ of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly\
    \ into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation\
    \ in the term \"modification\".)\n\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred\
    \ form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source\
    \ code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\
    \ interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and\
    \ installation of the library.\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution\
    \ and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.\
    \ The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output\
    \ from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\
    \ on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing\
    \ it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program\
    \ that uses the Library does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies\
    \ of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided\
    \ that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\
    \ copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that\
    \ refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy\
    \ of this License along with the Library.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical\
    \ act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection\
    \ in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library\
    \ or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\
    \ distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided\
    \ that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) The modified work must itself\
    \ be a software library.\nb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent\
    \ notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\nc) You\
    \ must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties\
    \ under the terms of this License.\nd) If a facility in the modified Library refers\
    \ to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that\
    \ uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked,\
    \ then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application\
    \ does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs\
    \ whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n(For example, a function in\
    \ a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined\
    \ independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied\
    \ function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application\
    \ does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\n\
    \nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections\
    \ of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered\
    \ independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,\
    \ do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But\
    \ when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\
    \ on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,\
    \ whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to\
    \ each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent\
    \ of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely\
    \ by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution\
    \ of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere\
    \ aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with\
    \ a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium\
    \ does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n\n3. You may\
    \ opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of\
    \ this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all\
    \ the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU\
    \ General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version\
    \ than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then\
    \ you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change\
    \ in these notices.\n\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible\
    \ for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent\
    \ copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\nThis option is useful when\
    \ you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not\
    \ a library.\n\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative\
    \ of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\
    \ Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding\
    \ machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\
    \ 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\nIf distribution\
    \ of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then\
    \ offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies\
    \ the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are\
    \ not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n5. A program\
    \ that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to\
    \ work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work\
    \ that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work\
    \ of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\nHowever,\
    \ linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable\
    \ that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library),\
    \ rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered\
    \ by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\
    \nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that\
    \ is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work\
    \ of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially\
    \ significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is\
    \ itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined\
    \ by law.\n\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure\
    \ layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines\
    \ or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless\
    \ of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object\
    \ code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n\nOtherwise,\
    \ if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code\
    \ for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work\
    \ also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the\
    \ Library itself.\n\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine\
    \ or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work\
    \ containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of\
    \ your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the\
    \ customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\
    \nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is\
    \ used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You\
    \ must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright\
    \ notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as\
    \ well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you\
    \ must do one of these things:\n\na) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\
    \ machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were\
    \ used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and,\
    \ if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable\
    \ \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\
    \ user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable\
    \ containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes\
    \ the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able\
    \ to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\nb) Use a suitable\
    \ shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism\
    \ is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the\
    \ user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable,\
    \ and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the\
    \ user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with\
    \ the version that the work was made with.\nc) Accompany the work with a written\
    \ offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified\
    \ in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this\
    \ distribution.\nd) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to\
    \ copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified\
    \ materials from the same place.\ne) Verify that the user has already received\
    \ a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\
    For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must\
    \ include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable\
    \ from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need\
    \ not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\
    \ form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating\
    \ system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\
    \ the executable.\n\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\
    \ restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the\
    \ operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the\
    \ Library together in an executable that you distribute.\n\n7. You may place library\
    \ facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library\
    \ together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute\
    \ such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work\
    \ based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted,\
    \ and provided that you do these two things:\n\na) Accompany the combined library\
    \ with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other\
    \ library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections\
    \ above.\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that\
    \ part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\
    \ accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n8. You may not copy, modify,\
    \ sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided\
    \ under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link\
    \ with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\
    \ rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,\
    \ from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long\
    \ as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n9. You are not required to accept\
    \ this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you\
    \ permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These\
    \ actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore,\
    \ by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library),\
    \ you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and\
    \ conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based\
    \ on it.\n\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\
    \ Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor\
    \ to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms\
    \ and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\
    \ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\
    \ compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n11. If, as a consequence of\
    \ a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason\
    \ (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
    \ order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
    \ they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\
    \ so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\
    \ other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\
    \ Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\
    \ redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly\
    \ through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\
    \ be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of\
    \ this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,\
    \ the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole\
    \ is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this\
    \ section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims\
    \ or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose\
    \ of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is\
    \ implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions\
    \ to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on\
    \ consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide\
    \ if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and\
    \ a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly\
    \ clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n\
    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries\
    \ either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder\
    \ who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution\
    \ limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only\
    \ in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\
    \ the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n13. The Free Software\
    \ Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public\
    \ License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the\
    \ present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\
    \nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies\
    \ a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library\
    \ does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published\
    \ by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of\
    \ the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible\
    \ with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is\
    \ copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\
    \n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\
    \ THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE\
    \ WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\
    \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to\
    \ Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\nIf you develop a new library, and\
    \ you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making\
    \ it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by\
    \ permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\
    \ of the ordinary General Public License).\n\nTo apply these terms, attach the\
    \ following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of\
    \ each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each\
    \ file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the\
    \ full notice is found.\n\none line to give the library's name and an idea of\
    \ what it does.\nCopyright (C) year name of author\n\nThis library is free software;\
    \ you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser\
    \ General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n\
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis library\
    \ is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;\
    \ without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\
    \ PURPOSE. See the GNU\nLesser General Public License for more details.\n\nYou\
    \ should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\nLicense along\
    \ with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\nFoundation, Inc., 51\
    \ Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\nAlso add information\
    \ on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your\
    \ employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"\
    copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter\
    \ the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in\nthe\
