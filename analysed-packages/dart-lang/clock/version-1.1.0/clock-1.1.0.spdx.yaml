    \   \n\n      \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\
    \ form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial\
    \ revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a\

    \n      \n\n      \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\

    \ royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license\
    \ to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer\

    \ by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s)\
    \ alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such\
    \ Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any\
    \ entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\
    \ the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or\
    \ contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under\
    \ this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is\
    \ filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\
    \ Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications,\
    \ and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\n\
    \n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works\
    \ a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to\
    \ carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c)\
    \ You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute,\

    \ Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file\
    \ as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\
    \ include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE\
    \ file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative\
    \ Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\
    \ as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if\
    \ provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by\
    \ the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.\
    \ The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not\
    \ modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative\
    \ Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from\
    \ the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\
    \ as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement\
    \ to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms\
    \ and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,\
    \ or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction,\
    \ and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in\
    \ this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state\
    \ otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\
    \ by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License,\
    \ without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing\
    \ herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement\
    \ you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks.\
    \ This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service\
    \ marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and\
    \ customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content\
    \ of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable\
    \ law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor\
    \ provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS\
    \ OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties\
    \ or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\
    \ PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness\
    \ of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your\
    \ exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability.\
    \ In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),\
    \ contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate\
    \ and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\
    \ liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,\
    \ or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License\
    \ or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to\
    \ damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,\
    \ or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\
    \ has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty\
    \ or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof,\
    \ You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,\
    \ indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\
    \ License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own\
    \ behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,\
    \ and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless\
    \ for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor\
    \ by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability. END OF\
    \ TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\
